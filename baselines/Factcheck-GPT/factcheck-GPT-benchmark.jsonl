Furthermore, particular mathematical computations have been demonstrated to work on a DNA computer. DNA computing does not provide any new capabilities from the standpoint of computability theory , the study of which problems are computationally solvable using different models of computation. For example, if the space required for the solution of a problem grows exponentially with the size of the problem ( EXPSPACE problems) on von Neumann machines , it still grows exponentially with the size of the problem on DNA machines. For very large EXPSPACE problems, the amount of DNA required is too large to be practical.","[26] [27] Improved speed with Localized (cache-like) Computing [ edit ] One of the challenges of DNA computing is its speed. While DNA as a substrate is biologically compatible i.e. it can be used at places where silicon technology cannot, its computation speed is still very slow. For example, the square-root circuit used as a benchmark in field took over 100 hours to complete.","Pros and cons [ edit ] The slow processing speed of a DNA computer (the response time is measured in minutes, hours or days, rather than milliseconds) is compensated by its potential to make a high amount of multiple parallel computations. This allows the system to take a similar amount of time for a complex calculation as for a simple one. This is achieved by the fact that millions or billions of molecules interact with each other simultaneously. However, it is much harder to analyze the answers given by a DNA computer than by a digital one.","Without the rapid computational advances in the past decade, it is unlikely that DNA sequencing would have the speed and low cost that it does today.

Where was the Abacus invented?","The principle of abacus counting remains the same: the right column represents ones, and each column to the left represents multiples of ten. To use the abacus counting to add two numbers, you will need to know how many digits there are in the most extended number. It will tell you how many columns you will need on your abacus. The columns represent powers of 10: ones, tens, hundreds, etc. That is how to read an abacus.","The Babylonians, Ancient Chinese, Japanese and Russians all used a calculating tool similar to a modern-day abacus.

Furthermore, a lesion study on a skilled abacus expert manifested the importance of the dorsal premotor and parietal cortex in the superior arithmetic ability of AMC experts [ 26 ].

The machine, called Titan, is located at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. It is also the fastest supercomputer the world. It can process more than 17 petaflops of data per second -- that's roughly 20,000 trillion simultaneous calculations.","The vanish of speed effect that the abacus-trained children performed computation tasks with faster speed [ 23 , 32 ] was probably due to the fact that the abacus-trained children in the present study were not as expert as that in previous studies. Anyway, our results still demonstrated the superior capability of numerical processing for abacus-trained children. A possible account for the better performance of abacus-trained children was that they may employ a different problem-solving strategy induced by the long-term abacus training. After the training, a \u201cmental abacus\u201d was formed in their brains [ 15 , 20 ], which may be helpful when they performed the arithmetical problems. This \u201cmental abacus\u201d may be the key reason for the improved performance of abacus-trained children in the EX calculation task.","The procedure of solving a calculation problem by abacus is shown in Figure 1(a) . After being familiar with the operation of the abacus, they are instructed to imagine moving beads with actual finger movements on an imagined abacus in minds and watching a real one at the same time. Finally, they calculate via an imagined abacus without moving fingers, as if manipulating a \u201cmental abacus\u201d [ 15 , 20 \u2013 24 ]. The existence of the \u201cimaginary abacus\u201d has been validated by previous studies, which indicated that the nonverbal visuospatial cerebral networks play an important role during calculation tasks in abacus experts [ 15 , 16 , 23 \u2013 27 ]. Recently, a study revealed that \u201cmental abacus\u201d was represented by a column-based model, in which the abacus is split into a series of columns and each column is independently stored as a unit with its own detailed substructure [ 24 ].","Titan, for example, will advance these digital drug tests, says Jack Wells, the director of science at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility.

There's still room for improvement on this estimate; the models did not quite reproduce the Milky Way's gamma radiation as it is currently observed; and the distance of the gamma ray source could alter the final estimate, but is tricky to gauge. This is why the researchers could only give a range for the star formation rate, rather than a pinpointed mass. However, the team's method shows promise for better understanding how the Milky Way makes new stars.

The result is a lot of baby stars: the most productive starburst galaxies convert 300 Suns worth of gas into new stars each year, compared to the Milky Way\u2019s two or three. Many of those stars are also very massive, which means they burn brighter and hotter than the Sun. Massive stars like that are relatively short-lived; between that and the rapid consumption of available materials for star formation, starburst galaxies don\u2019t keep up their rapid production of stars for very long, in cosmic terms. The starburst galaxy we observe today may not have been that way a few million years ago, and will have calmed down again in the future.","Still, he says it\u2019s unlikely to be as low as the standard two solar masses per year. In any event, the Milky Way is the most vigorous star creator in a collection of more than 100 nearby galaxies called the Local Group. The largest Local Group galaxy, Andromeda, converts only a fraction of a solar mass of gas and dust into new stars a year. Among Local Group galaxies, the Milky Way ranks second in size, but its high star formation rate means that we definitely try a lot harder. Questions or comments on this article?","The more stars our galaxy spawns, the more gamma rays emerge. The best match with the observations, the researchers find, is a star formation rate of four to eight solar masses a year. That is much higher than the standard estimate for the Milky Way of about two solar masses a year . The revised rate is very realistic, says Pavel Kroupa, an astronomer at the University of Bonn in Germany who was not involved in the work. \u201cI\u2019m very impressed by the detailed modeling of how they account for the star formation process,\u201d he says.","The Milky Way contains between 100 and 400 billion stars [12] [13] and at least that many planets. [142] An exact figure would depend on counting the number of very-low-mass stars, which are difficult to detect, especially at distances of more than 300 ly (90 pc) from the Sun. As a comparison, the neighboring Andromeda Galaxy contains an estimated one trillion (10 12 ) stars.

Unfortunately I'm not an expert on the specifics of the detection of such events, but from all I understand we detect this by measuring gravitational waves. Now I think many galaxies have a supermassive black hole in the center.","Other research groups using telescopes in Europe, Australia, India, and China also say they're starting to see hints of these waves. A new class of space ripples Until now, scientists have only been able to detect gravitational waves created by much smaller black holes. The first were seen in 2015, when a research consortium registered the waves created by the merger of two black holes that were each about 30 times as massive as the sun. That landmark discovery showed that gravitational waves truly existed, fulfilling a prediction made by Albert Einstein in 1916 and giving researchers a new way to study exotic phenomena like black holes and neutron stars. 13.7:","NANOGrav\/Sonoma State University\/Aurore Simonnet Scientists say they are starting to find signs of an elusive type of rumbling through space that could be created by the biggest, baddest black holes in the universe. The discovery means that astrophysicists may have opened a whole new window onto supermassive black holes. These mysterious, extremely dense objects, millions to billions of times more massive than the sun, sit at the center of galaxies like our own. When two galaxies merge, the enormous black holes at their centers are thought to come together and circle each other in a spinning dance that sends giant waves spiraling out. These waves are like the ripples that move through a pond if you toss in a rock \u2014 only these waves move through the very fabric of the universe, and researchers have been eager to study them."],["The first direct gravitational-wave signal that we found came from the merger of two massive black holes. The detection was made possible by the building of a very sensitive detector known as LIGO. In 2017, scientists detected gravitational waves from the merger of two collapsed objects with masses on the order of one and a half times the mass of the Sun.

They are instead relatively massive stellar-mass black holes . Regarding your other question - it is indeed quite likely that the source is in fact a pair of merging black holes. Regrettably, no other gravitational wave detectors were online at the time of detection by LIGO. Additionally, the Swift gamma-ray detector reported that it found no counterpart to the merger in the small part of the electromagnetic spectrum it surveyed ( Evans et al. (2016) )","[1] Resonant mass antennas [ edit ] A simple device to detect the expected wave motion is called a resonant mass antenna \u2013 a large, solid body of metal isolated from outside vibrations. This type of instrument was the first type of gravitational-wave detector. Strains in space due to an incident gravitational wave excite the body's resonant frequency and could thus be amplified to detectable levels. Conceivably, a nearby supernova might be strong enough to be seen without resonant amplification.","Supermassive black hole pairs could have a trick up their sleeves, though. They could emit energy as powerful gravitational waves as they orbit one another until eventually they collide in a cataclysmic finale. \u201cOnce the two black holes get close enough to be seen by pulsar timing arrays, nothing can stop them from merging within just a few million years,\u201d says Luke Kelley of the University of California, Berkeley , chair of NANOGrav\u2019s astrophysics group. The existence of the gravitational wave background found by NANOGrav seems to back up this prediction, potentially putting the final parsec problem to rest. Since supermassive black hole pairs form due to galaxy mergers, the abundance of their gravitational waves will help cosmologists estimate how frequently galaxies have collided throughout the universe\u2019s history.","A key component in such mergers is the behavior of black holes \u2014 areas of space that have intense gravity and can grow by gobbling up gas and dust from their immediate surroundings. For the study, astronomers enlisted a variety of powerful instruments to observe the late-stage merger of the galaxy UGC4211, located 500 million light years from Earth in the constellation Cancer. Using multiple instruments enabled researchers to observe the side-by-side black holes in different wavelengths and gather a more complete picture of the phenomenon.

The resulting flare marks the first time that optical light has been observed from a black hole-black hole merger. Caltech\/R. Hurt (IPAC) While hopes were initially high that merging black holes might produce light signals, that enthusiasm faded over recent years as merger after merger failed to turn up any signal at all. With this new event, excitement is now rekindled : perhaps black holes only need the right circumstances to flare when they merge, and that future observations will ultimately reveal the link between merging black holes and the emission of light.","The two supermassive black holes may stay with their respective galaxy. It is possible that the two supermassive black holes will merge into one. It is also possible that one of the supermassive black holes will get ejected. It is also possible that stellar black holes in the two galaxies merge into a single supermassive black hole. This is less likely as it would require hundreds of thousands or more black holes to merge.","When the two black holes merge, their event horizons coalesce, but there's still no way that light should be able to escape. When two compact masses merge, such as neutron stars or black holes, they produce gravitational ... [+] waves. The amplitude of the wave signals are proportional to the black hole masses. LIGO and Virgo, combined, have now found candidate black holes both above and below the previously anticipated mass range, but black hole-black hole mergers do not typically generate an electromagnetic signal.","The two objects have moved steadily toward each other for about 100 million years, according to a statement from NASA , and now they share a binary orbit, with the two black holes orbiting each other every two years or so.

Astronomers don't know how these objects get to be quite so big, but one possibility is that the universe's largest black holes result from at least one merger between two smaller black holes, according to NASA. The new study may help to confirm that hypothesis. PKS 2131-021 is a special type of black hole known as a blazar \u2014 basically, a supermassive black hole that happens to be pointing a jet of supercharged matter directly at Earth. The researchers suspected that these variations were the result of a second black hole tugging on the first as the two objects orbit each other every two years or so, but the team needed more data to see how long this pattern held.","It was in this accretion disk that astronomers spotted signals of a second orbiting supermassive black hole. As that second black hole plunges through the accretion disk surrounding the main black hole, it triggers a series of flares. These flares arise as the diving black hole heats the disk of material and causes it to \"burp\" out hot gas as expanding bubbles. The gas bubbles cool over a period of months, radiating light and emitting flashes that last around two weeks and are brighter than the combined light from a trillion stars or the entire light output from the Milky Way .

So imagine the surprise of astronomers when they saw evidence that a black hole's magnetic field had undergone a magnetic reversal. In basic terms, a magnetic field can be imaged as that of a simple magnet, with a north and south pole. A magnetic reversal is where the orientation of that imaginary pole flips, and the orientation of the magnetic field flips.","$\\begingroup$ In theory , a charged and rotating black hole can generate its own magnetic field. The magnetic (and electric) field can exist and can be measured outside the event horizon of the black hole. I completely agree with both existing answers that magnetic field does not \"escape\" from black holes, however I would argue that it is extremely unlikely that any real astrophysical black hole generates a significant magnetic field. The simple reason for this is that is is extremely difficult to see how any realistic physical process would deposit material with a net charge inside the black hole. i.e. Most astrophysical black holes are expected to be uncharged and have no magnetic field.","The magnetic fields you are thinking of, and which are referred to in the link that you provide, are fields that are generated within the accretion disk of material that is spiralling in towards the event horizon. i.e. They are generated outside the black hole, and are completely unrelated to the magnetic field that you show for a planet like Jupiter, where the field is generated by processes inside the planet.

If Neutron stars can generate extreme magnetic fields, presumably from un-matched protons and\/or electrons within the dense mass and moving with star-rotation, then Black Holes should be capable of doing so, as well. Magnetic fields exist in space surrounding their source - moving charged particles - and if space is warped extremely, per space-time-curvature concepts, then the field lines should be warped with the space. If they extend beyond the event horizon, then we'd have to find a different means of action-at-a-distance for gravitation, consistent with the proven formulas, if not the under-lying concept \"explaining\" action at a distance, of General Relativity. The observational challenge is that accretion disks also contain moving charges that generate strong magnetic fields, and it is not clear how one might distinguish between fields generated within the event horizon from those generated without.","X-rays are often produced by charged particles spiraling within intense magnetic fields, so this suggested a sudden change in the magnetic field near the black hole. At the same time, the intensity of light in visible and ultraviolet increased which suggested that parts of the black hole's accretion disk were getting hotter. Neither of these effects is what you'd expect with a tidal disruption event. Instead, a magnetic reversal better fits the data. As the team showed, as a black hole accretion disk undergoes a magnetic reversal, the fields weaken at the outer edges of the accretion disk first."],["Neutron stars are historically called stars because they are round, massive, and compact \u2014 no better reason, and that convention doesn\u2019t hold for white dwarfs.

Mallozzi, University of Alabama in Huntsville and NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. Neutron stars have extremely strong magnetic fields. Some of them, known as magnetars have the strongest magnetic fields in the entire universe, a hundred million times stronger than the strongest man-made magnetic fields. These magnetic poles of these stars emit cones of light in radio, optical, X-ray or gamma-ray wavelengths. Much like a lighthouse, the rotation of the neutron stars periodically sweeps these cones of light in the direction of the Earth, causing us to see a pulsating star, or a pulsar .","Some pulsars spin over a thousand times a second. A neutron star generates a gravitational pull so powerful that a marshmallow impacting the star's surface would hit with the force of a thousand hydrogen bombs. Magnetars, the most magnetic stars known, aren't powered by a conventional mechanism such as nuclear fusion or rotation, according to Dr. Vicky Kaspi. \"Magnetars represent a new way for a star to shine, which makes this a fascinating field,\" said Kaspi. Although not totally understood yet, magnetars have magnetic fields a thousand times stronger than ordinary neutron stars that measure a million billion Gauss , or about a hundred-trillion refrigerator magnets.","They're known to erupt without warning, some for hours and others for months, before dimming and disappearing again. At left is an artist's rendering of an erupting neutron star. It can generate the most intense magnetic field observed in the Universe. The field strength of a magnetar is one thousand trillion times stronger than Earth's and is so intense that it heats the surface to 18 million degrees Fahrenheit. \"We only know of about 10 magnetars in the Milky Way galaxy.\" remarked Dr. Peter Woods of the Universities Space Research Association.","[2] Magnetars are differentiated from other neutron stars by having even stronger magnetic fields, and by rotating more slowly in comparison. Most observed magnetars rotate once every two to ten seconds, [8] whereas typical neutron stars, observed as radio pulsars, rotate one to ten times per second. [9] A magnetar's magnetic field gives rise to very strong and characteristic bursts of X-rays and gamma rays. The active life of a magnetar is short compared to other celestial bodies. Their strong magnetic fields decay after about 10,000 years, after which activity and strong X-ray emission cease.","In a supernova , a star collapses to a neutron star, and its magnetic field increases dramatically in strength through conservation of magnetic flux .

The larger the mass the larger the inertia. Both Galileo and Newton inferred that because of inertia, objects which are not being pushed or pulled, if initially motionless, will remain motionless. If the object already moving with a constant velocity, if there are no forces to speed it up or slow it down, it will continue in a straight line with the same velocity. Newton made the above statement more precise by articulating the concept of force, a vector quantity.","It says that the net force ( a vector ) acting on a mass m ( a number ) causes an acceleration ( a vector ) of the object in the same direction as the net force. The net force is the combined force of all individual forces acting on an object. Newton's First Law can be seen to be the special case in the Second Law when F , the net force, is zero. When that happens, the acceleration a must also be zero. Since acceleration is given by the change of velocity divided by elapsed time, the velocity doesn't change."],["I understand that in collisions where one object is initially at rest, the force of friction on both objects will be opposite.

Jupiter Jupiter's axial tilt is rather small, completely consistent with the dominant planetary formation model. Jupiter's rotation is the least surprising of the giant planets, most likely because Jupiter is the most massive of the giant planets. Saturn Saturn is Jupiter's smaller sibling, a gas giant that rotates quite rapidly.","There is strong evidence that Mars' obliquity (axial tilt) has undergone chaotic variations in the past. Mars is yet another special case. The giant planets The giant planets are thought to have initially formed by a process similar to (but more rapid than) the way in which the terrestrial planets formed. That initial rocky\/icy nucleus would have orbited the proto-Sun slightly faster than the gas and dust in the immediate vicinity. This enabled the proto giant planets to sweep up gas, ices, and dust from the protoplanetary disk.","As it collapses in on itself, it starts rotating faster and faster, forming a disc. The bulk of this coalesces into a big ball of hydrogen at the centre, which will eventually form a star. The matter in the disc slowly starts to clump together more and more to form the planets (it's a little more complicated than this, but if you're interested it's an easy topic to read up on). Similarly to how the overall cloud starts spinning faster and faster, the matter that forms these planets was spinning and maintains its spin as it clumps together into planets. The previous post has covered your other questions.","Thus, in the Jupiter zone, accretion quickly made a protoplanet whose mass grew to 1 to 2 to 5 and to 10 Earth masses. At this point, the protoplanet's gravity was strong enough to grab the H and He gas that it was orbiting within (the gas disk), making a giant, gaseous planet. We now know from our observations of the giant planets that all four of them - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - all have solid cores of about 10 Earth masses. Thus, a theoretical prediction of the planet building process has been confirmed by our robotic spacecraft observations of the planets. In the inner solar system, the forming planets never became big enough to grab the H and He gas.","orbits of planets are nearly circular (see eccentricity values ) all planets spin. Most spin in the same (prograde) direction in which they revolve around the Sun.

Can someone explain to me how a planet with no surface can have a gravitational pull? NASA's webpage on Jupiter and Saturn (from which the information below was derived) explains that while it's not a certainty that there is much rock at the core of these planets there's a lot of compressed hydrogen, along with heavier elements. With enough gravity and pressure the electrons can be stripped from the atoms leaving a core consisting of protons (source for that statement below), metallic hydrogen and metallic helium . Jupiter has a radius of 43,440.7 miles, Saturn 36,183.7 miles, and Earth is only 3,959 miles.","Some newly formed planets had a large enough mass , and with it, a large gravitational force, to pull on and capture smaller objects that were moving past them. These smaller objects fell into orbit around larger planets, becoming their moons. As the planets began to settle into orbits the pull of gravity from their own center of mass pulled them in on themselves, tugging at each planet\u2019s mass equally towards its center. This strong internal gravitational pull gives planets their round, spherical shape . But that\u2019s not the only force working on planets.","And Orbits Every planet in the solar system is affected by multiple forces. The gravity of the Sun pulls planets toward the center of the solar system. The inertia from the creation of the planets sent them flying in a straight line, perpendicular to the force of the Sun\u2019s gravity. When these forces combine, they result in centripetal forces that push our planets in their circular motion around the Sun. You will use a marble and a disposable plate to observe, examine, and test the limits of centripetal force.","What about the giant planets?

This is true for anything that spins, like a wheel, a DVD, or a fan. Things along the edge have to travel the farthest and fastest. Along the equator of a planet, a circle half way between the north and south poles, gravity is holding the edges in but, as it spins, stuff wants to spin out like mud flying off a tire. Saturn and Jupiter are really big and spinning really fast but gravity still manages to hold them together.","The Effects of Gravity in the Solar System Updated April 24, 2017 By Drew Lichtenstein The more massive a planet or star is, the stronger the gravitational force it exerts.

In contrast, epigenetic inheritance involves the transmission of epigenetic information, which is not encoded in the DNA sequence itself but rather in chemical modifications to the DNA molecule or associated proteins. Step 3\/6 2. Genetic inheritance is based on the principle that the DNA sequence remains constant across generations, with occasional mutations that can lead to variation. Epigenetic inheritance, on the other hand, involves changes in gene expression or activity that can be passed down through generations without altering the underlying DNA sequence.","The preponderance of evidence suggests that genotypes predispose epitypes for most chromatin structures that are transgenerationally inherited and this relationship contributes to the penetrance of epigenetically controlled diseases. Genotypes influencing inherited epigenetic risk are often obscurely encoded in DNA sequence and small RNAs.

Some of the best characterized examples that were discussed herein suggest we are only just beginning to understand the molecular biology behind inherited epigenome-induced disorders. Finally, the paths to effective therapeutic development or to lowering epigenetic risk will be easier to trace out once we understand the mechanisms by which genotype predisposes epitype for a particular disease.","Addressing these other epigenetic controls would distract this discussion from a focus on the transgenerational inheritance of chromatin structures.

A shift in nucleosome position in penetrant alleles could affect downstream cytosine methylation and histone PTM, resulting in higher Axin1Fu gene expression and the kinked tail phenotype. By this view, genotype determines the nucleosomal epitype, which produces other aberrant hypomethylation and histone PTM epitypes, leading to increased gene expression and the novel kinked tail phenotype (Figure 1 , Figure 2 A, Table 1 ).

[1] Despite not directly altering the DNA sequence, epigenetic mechanisms can regulate gene expression through chemical modifications of DNA bases and changes to the chromosomal superstructure in which DNA is packaged. Briefly, negatively charged DNA is packaged around a positively charged histone protein octamer, which contains 2 copies of histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4.

[1] Despite not directly altering the DNA sequence, epigenetic mechanisms can regulate gene expression through chemical modifications of DNA bases and changes to the chromosomal superstructure in which DNA is packaged. Briefly, negatively charged DNA is packaged around a positively charged histone protein octamer, which contains 2 copies of histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. [2] This nucleoprotein complex is a nucleosome, the basic unit of chromatin. [3] The nucleosomes of a continuous DNA polymer are connected by linker DNA and the complex is stabilized by histone protein H1.","Certain aspects of genetics, such as passing genes to future generations, are fairly straightforward and well known, at least generally.

Two siblings may have the same gene but due to epigenetics the gene might express one way in one child and a different way in the other.","[15] This epigenetic mechanism also plays an important role in tissue-specific gene regulation, genomic imprinting, and X chromosome inactivation. [14] The second epigenetic mechanism is post-translational modifications to histone proteins. These modifications include enzyme-catalyzed acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitylation, each of which alters the DNA-histone interactions in nucleosomes. [16] Histone acetylation often occurs at positively charged lysine residues which weakens the DNA-histone interactions, thus opening the chromatin and facilitating transcription. [17] For example, acetylation of lysine 9 and lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K9ac and H3K27ac, respectively) correlates with transcription activation."],["Another common epigenetic change is histone modification. Histones are structural proteins in the cell nucleus. DNA wraps around histones, giving chromosomes their shape. Histones can be modified by the addition or removal of chemical groups, such as methyl groups or acetyl groups (each consisting of two carbon, three hydrogen, and one oxygen atoms). The chemical groups influence how tightly the DNA is wrapped around histones, which affects whether a gene can be turned on or off.","Where does this type of genetic memory come from? The answer lies in a phenomenon called epigenetics, which describes molecular events that occur on DNA but not within the DNA sequence. Remarkably, epigenetic changes to DNA are branded into the genome in a manner that can sometimes be inherited by future generations. What, then, are these traces \u2014 these brands that somehow stick to the lineages of organisms? Epigenetic events have both intrigued and puzzled researchers over the years .","How Can Your Epigenetics Change? Your epigenetics change as you age, both as part of normal development and aging and in response to your behaviors and environment. Epigenetics and Development Epigenetic changes begin before you are born. All your cells have the same genes but look and act differently. As you grow and develop, epigenetics helps determine which function a cell will have, for example, whether it will become a heart cell, nerve cell, or skin cell.","Welcome Login Register My Bio-Rad Log Out Unlike phenotypes that are associated with mutations in the underlying DNA code, epigenetic changes involve heritable covalent modifications to chromatin structure, such as DNA methylation and histone modification. Here we highlight common epigenetic markers, the techniques used to study them, and their role in biology and human disease. Non-coding RNAs (e.g., microRNA), also involved in epigenetic regulation, are discussed in detail in The Coding and Non-Coding RNA .","Epigenetic modifications can be maintained from cell to cell as cells divide and, in some cases, can be inherited through the generations. A common type of epigenetic modification is called DNA methylation. DNA methylation involves the attachment of small chemical groups called methyl groups (each consisting of one carbon atom and three hydrogen atoms) to DNA building blocks. When methyl groups are present on a gene, that gene is turned off or silenced, and no protein is produced from that gene.

Epigenetic Mechanisms How does epigenetic inheritance occur concretely? Although several epigenetic processes have been considered to answer this question, given the wide range of this work, we will focus on two of the more extensively studied mechanisms: methylation and ncRNA. First-Generation Epigenetic Mechanisms First-generation epigenetic mechanisms are centered on modifications to chromatin density\u2014i.e., a \u201ctuning\u201d of transcriptional probability. Although these processes might mediate epigenetic inheritance, methylation is the most well-understood mechanism regarding this matter ( Babenko et al., 2015 ).","And epigenetic changes can happen in many individuals at once. Through epigenetic inheritance, some of the experiences of the parents may pass to future generations. At the same time, the epigenome remains flexible as environmental conditions continue to change.

As unconventional as it may be, there is little doubt that epigenetic inheritance is real.","Does epigenetic inheritance influence genetic adaptation? Epigenetic inheritance can aid adaptation in two ways. Firstly, adaptive environmentally induced epigenetic inheritance can move a population closer to a fitness peak, than if they would rely only on genetic change (Kronholm and Collins 2016 ). If the new environment is stable, genetic change may ultimately follow, according to the same principles as the genetic fixation of initially induced phenotypes (i.e. genetic assimilation). Secondly, because of the high epi-mutation rate (Graaf et al. 2015 ), selection can act upon randomly induced epigenetic variants that if they are inherited, can aid adaptation in a similar scenario as described above."],["[78] [79] [80] Mechanisms [ edit ] Epigenetic mechanisms are sensitive to environmental effects, and key participants in shaping an adult phenotype. [81] Several types of epigenetic inheritance systems may play a role in what has become known as cell memory, [82] note however that not all of these are universally accepted to be examples of epigenetics. Therefore, the word \"epigenetics\" is sometimes used as a synonym for these processes. However, this can be misleading.

The environment is another level that confirms its well-established function as an epigenetic regulator and is also thus a potentially invaluable therapeutic \u201ctool\u201d ( Maccari et al., 2017 ). To strengthen the therapeutic power of the environment, paradoxically, we must understand the specific mechanisms that are altered by epigenetic adaptations following certain experiences.","An epigenetic effect that continues into the 4th generation could be inherited and not due to direct exposure. Researchers face the added challenge that epigenetic changes are transient by nature. That is, the epigenome changes more rapidly than the relatively fixed DNA code. An epigenetic change that was triggered by environmental conditions may be reversed when environmental conditions change again. Three generations at once are exposed to the same environmental conditions (diet, toxins, hormones, etc.).","For this reason, we will attempt to unify and organize this potentially confusing terminological flowering in a coherent conceptual framework.

When a substance is mixed with water, the substance's ions can interact with the water molecules through ion-dipole and hydrogen bonding, causing the water molecules to rearrange themselves into a specific structure (Fang, et al., 2010). This structural arrangement is then retained even after the substance has been diluted or removed, allowing water to retain a memory of the substance with which it was mixed (Fang, et al., 2010). \r\nReferences: \r\nEisenberg, D., & Kauzmann, D.

Our theoretical assumptions originate from the Structural Information (Theory (SIT) (Buffart & Leeuwenberg, 1983; Leeuwenberg, 1969), a theory concerning the perceptible structures in an object and the human preference for one of these structures. A symbolic notation of such a perceptible structure in an object is called a representation .","The property of cohesion describes the ability of water molecules to be attracted to other water molecules, which allows water to be a \"sticky\" liquid. Hydrogen bonds are attractions of electrostatic force caused by the difference in charge between slightly positive hydrogen ions and other, slightly negative ions. In the case of water, hydrogen bonds form between neighboring hydrogen and oxygen atoms of adjacent water molecules. The attraction between individual water molecules creates a bond known as a hydrogen bond. Sources\/Usage Public Domain.","The representations and relations can be seen as respectively the nodes and links in a network . This network is the basis for the Structural Memory. We therefore assign an activation value to each representation in the network, expressing the strength of the preference for the described structure at a certain moment. By means of a process model we are able to make predictions for the strength of the preference for a perceptible structure in an object. It is shown that with two of these process models some experiments by Van Leeuwen and Buffart can be simulated.","Biology Molecular Biology Basics Water and Life 2 Answers mrpauller.weebly.com Apr 17, 2015 The polarity of water molecules means that molecules of water will stick to each other.

Genetic variation, which results in part from gene transfer in prokaryotes and sexual reproduction in higher organisms, allows tremendously increased phenotypic variability in a population as well as an accelerated rate of evolutionary divergence.","If they die without reproducing, their genes are usually removed from the gene pool, although exceptions exist. At the molecular level, genes and their encoding proteins can evolve \u201cselfishly,\u201d and these can combine with other selfish genes to form selfish operons, genetic units and functional parasitic elements such as viruses. Two corollaries of the Third Law are that (1) all living organisms contain homologous macromolecules (DNA, RNA, and proteins) that derived from a common ancestor, and (2) the genetic code is universal. These two observations provide compelling evidence for the Third Law of Biology. Because of his accurate enunciation of the Third Law, Charles Darwin is considered by many to be the greatest biologist of all time.","A second corollary of the Second Law is that all life is programmed by genetic instructions. Genetic instructions are required for cell division, morphogenesis, and differentiation. From single-celled prokaryotic organisms to normal or cancerous tissues in multicellular animals and plants, genetic instructions are required for the maintenance of life. The Third Law of Biology: all living organisms arose in an evolutionary process. This law correctly predicts the relatedness of all living organisms on Earth.","Posted By: Gert Korthof You ask 'Why it's so hard to formulate laws of biology?' and 'Why is it so much easier to talk about laws of physics?' An important factor must be that physical objects are dead, far less complex, all atoms of an isotope are identical, while biological 'objects' are literally unique individuals with a history. Considering these differences it makes no sense to demand universal, exceptionless laws in biology.

The mass of a star is the main factor in determining how its life cycle will progress. More massive stars burn faster and hotter, while smaller stars burn cooler for much longer. What is a difference between the cycle of a low and high mass star? The life cycles of stars of different masses diverge after their expansion into a red giant: a high mass star will result in a supernova once its fuel runs out, whereas a low mass star will cool off and become a dwarf star once the fuel runs out.","The Life Cycle of a Star - Key takeaways Stars have different sizes, which determine how their life cycle progresses. Stars are born in a nebula and die when they run out of fuel to supply nuclear reactions in the core strong enough to balance their own gravity. Low mass stars evolve into red giants and high mass stars evolve into red supergiant. Red giants eventually cool to become black dwarfs over incredibly long amounts of time.

Answer 3: A star is formed when a cloud of gas and dust in space has enough mass that the gravity from that mass pulls the material of that cloud to a central point rather than the particles of gas and dust escaping by their own velocity. As this material collects to a central point, atoms and molecules start bumping into each other. As more and more material collects, the material bumps together with higher and higher energy, making heat. With still further collection of material to the center of mass, the energy of hydrogen atoms bumping into one another becomes so great that they will occasionally fuse together to form a helium atom.","The combination of the radius and the mass of a star determines the surface gravity . Giant stars have a much lower surface gravity than main sequence stars , while the opposite is the case for degenerate, compact stars such as white dwarfs. The surface gravity can influence the appearance of a star's spectrum, with higher gravity causing a broadening of the absorption lines . [3] Range [ edit ] One of the most massive stars known is Eta Carinae , [4] with 100\u2013200 M \u2609 ; its lifespan is very short\u2014only several million years at most.","Hydrogen and helium gas is very poor at radiating away energy but molecular gas (things like carbon monoxide) and dust are quite efficient radiators. Dust also aids in forming molecules in the first place by providing a site for these chemical reactions to take place - i.e. it catalyses molecule formation, which are then able to act as coolants. Finally, dust can play an important role through its high opacity to UV radiation. This can shield gas from external ionising sources, which would otherwise keep them hot and prevent the initiation of star formation.

Some are binaries, which means the revolve around one another, while others just appear together because they are in the same line of sight. Binary Star A binary star is a system of two stars that rotate around a common centre of mass. About half of stars are in a binary star system.","If they accumulate enough mass in these star-forming regions, some stars are pulled toward each other by gravity , forming pairs , multiple systems, or star clusters . Why do stars evolve? Stellar evolution occurs when a star loses its energy from continuous nuclear fusion reactions, causing instability due to decreasing gas pressure. In order to maintain stability, the star burns fuel in its core until it is depleted, causing the core to collapse into, depending on whether the star is low- or high-mass, either a dense white dwarf , a neutron star , or a black hole . star , any massive self-luminous celestial body of gas that shines by radiation derived from its internal energy sources."],["[7] Together they comprise the StarD1\/D3 subfamily of START domain-containing proteins.

Hormones that stimulate its production depend on the cell type and include luteinizing hormone (LH), ACTH and angiotensin II . At the cellular level, StAR is synthesized typically in response to activation of the cAMP second messenger system , although other systems can be involved even independently of cAMP .

(Image credit: NASA) Crystals of proteins that could be useful in medical research can be grown bigger and better in space than on Earth, according to the results of experiments performed on the International Space Station. Medical research often focuses on examining how proteins work . That can include learning how to use proteins in medicines, or finding proteins that cause problems for humans and making drugs to fight them.","This protein is an enzyme found in most living organisms that plays an important role in bone formation, DNA synthesis, and the making and breaking down of fats, the researchers said. The protein crystallization system the scientists developed for the experiments uses tiny tubes to control the flow of a solution containing dissolved proteins. The geometry of the tubes forces the proteins to concentrate in part of the solution, causing it to become supersaturated, meaning there are too many proteins to stay comfortably dissolved. The proteins then emerge from the solution to form a crystal. The researchers launched their system to the space station on April 18, 2014, inside a Dragon cargo spacecraft built by the private spaceflight company SpaceX.","To decipher a protein's 3D structure, researchers often make the protein into a crystal (so it is frozen in a rigid pose) and then scan the crystals with X-rays or neutron beams. The larger and purer a protein crystal is, the better the chance that scientists can work out that protein's 3D structure. [ The 6 Coolest Space Shuttle Experiments ] Most of the more than 100,000 3D protein structures that scientists have collected to date have come from X-ray scans. However, these X-ray scans cannot detect hydrogen atoms, which make up about 50 percent of the atoms in these proteins and may play important roles in the protein's activity. Neutron scans can determine the precise locations of these hydrogen atoms, but these require large protein crystals, which are difficult to grow.","A trio of scientists believe they've identified the very first protein from outer space. They found the proteins in two meteorite samples, the Allende meteorite and the Acfer 086 meteorites, which researchers previously discovered in Mexico in 1969 and Algeria in 1990, respectively. The scientists\u2014who hail from Harvard University, PLEX Corporation, and Bruker Scientific\u2014posted the research to the preprint server ArXiv on February 22. Proteins were \u201cdiscovered in Allende and Acfer 086 with extra-terrestrial isotope enhancement that confirmed that these unexpected molecules were not artifacts due to terrestrial contamination,\u201d they wrote. They dubbed the protein, which is similar to proteins commonly found on Earth, hemolithin.","Proteins are responsible for every aspect of life. Proteins can sense motion, light, taste and smell, and then convey such information to other parts of the body. Moreover, proteins are an essential component of the immune system that protects your body against pathogens. Proteins even synthesize DNA, which bears genetic information.

Top Democrats in New York condemned the decision and warned it will imperil public safety.","5 In what cases has the High Court of Australia held a federal law unconstitutional and invalid? 4 Is it constitutional for a state law to effectively mandate that a provision cannot be overruled by a federal court except the Supreme Court? 19 How willing is the US Supreme Court to declare itself wrong? 1 Can constitution amendment interpretation be negated by the Supreme Court in the US by citing unconstitutional during judicial review?","New York Supreme Court Justice Richard McNally ruled that neither man had shown proper cause to carry guns in public because they failed to demonstrate that they had a special need for self-protection. The plaintiffs then challenged that denial in a federal court in New York. They argued that the state law governing concealed-carry licenses, which allows them only for applicants with \"good moral character\" who have \"proper cause\" to carry guns outside the home, violates the Second Amendment. After a federal judge in New York dismissed the case, the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that judgment. The U.S. Supreme Court then took the case."],["Marbury v. Madison (1803) Holding: Established the doctrine of judicial review. In the Judiciary Act of 1789, Congress gave the Supreme Court the authority to issue certain judicial writs. The Constitution did not give the Court this power. Because the Constitution is the Supreme Law of the Land, the Court held that any contradictory congressional Act is without force. The ability of federal courts to declare legislative and executive actions unconstitutional is known as judicial review.","It was not rewritten but modified by amendments to the 1894 Constitution. THE NEW YORK STATE CONSTITUTION OF 1777 New York\u2019s first Constitution was drafted right after New York\u2019s Fourth Provincial Congress declared New York independent of Great Britain in 1776. It was formally adopted by the Convention of Representatives of the State of New York meeting in the upstate town of Kingston, on April 20 th , 1777. The Constitution declared the possibility of reconciliation between the British and its former American colonies even if uncertain and remote.","Share this: On June 23, the Supreme Court of the United States handed down its decision in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen , overturning a New York gun safety law. The Court ruled that New York\u2019s law requiring a license to carry concealed weapons in public places is unconstitutional. Notably, the overturned law didn't exist in isolation; it was similar to laws in seven other states, the combined populations of which account for over a quarter of the people in the United States. The Bruen decision threatens those laws \u2014 in fact, Maryland suspended a similar law on July 8, just two weeks after the decision. Two days after SCOTUS's ruling, President Biden signed bipartisan gun safety legislation, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act , into law.","This power of judicial review allowed Marshall to substantiate the Court\u2019s power by ruling that section 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 was void and violated Article 3 of the Constitution. Without this power, the provisions within the First Amendment and elsewhere in the Bill of Rights would not have had nearly the impact they have had in American history. Marshall reinforced the national goverment's power over the states Marshall\u2019s legal skill further reinforced the national government\u2019s power over the states. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in McCulloch v. Maryland (1819) , upholding the constitutionality of the national bank, broadly interpreted the \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d clause of Article 1, section 8 of the Constitution. Marshall believed this clause provided the basis for additional \u201cimplied powers\u201d to belong to Congress, and he did not believe that states had the power to frustrate such powers by taxing federal institutions.","Skip to main content Law 101: Fundamentals of the Law CHAPTER 4 Search for: HOW THE UNITED STATES AND NEW YORK STATE CONSTITUTIONS AFFECTS OUR LIVES INTRODUCTION This chapter will discuss two very important legal documents, the New York State Constitution and the United States Constitution. When most people mention the \u201cConstitution\u201d they are usually referring to the United States Constitution which was ratified in 1788. However, 11 years early, New York State had adopted its first of four Constitutions, with the last major modifications occurring back in 1938. This chapter will discuss both Constitutions and how they impact our lives as citizens of both the United States of America and New York State."],["\u201cOnce again, the U.S. Supreme Court has decided to allow our state\u2019s gun safety laws to remain in effect. We all see the heart-wrenching news from communities throughout New York state about the lives that are lost to senseless gun violence. We know that gun safety laws help save lives, and keep our state safer. My office will continue to work tirelessly to stand up for New York\u2019s gun safety laws and we will use every tool at our disposal to protect New Yorkers.\u201d As a result of today\u2019s decision, the full CCIA continues to be in effect.","And we have been made aware of no less restrictive, but equally effective, alternative. After considering all of these factors, the Second Circuit held that New York\u2019s law does not unconstitutionally burden the right to bear arms under the Second Amendment . I would affirm that holding. New York\u2019s Legislature considered the empirical evidence about gun violence and adopted a reasonable licensing law to regulate the concealed carriage of handguns in order to keep the people of New York safe. The Court today strikes down that law based only on the pleadings.","The New York legislature passed the law, known as the Concealed Carry Improvement Act, just eight days after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen . The law at the center of Bruen required anyone who wanted to carry a concealed handgun outside the home to show \u201cproper cause\u201d for a license. New York courts interpreted that phrase to require applicants to show more than a general desire to protect themselves or their property, but the Supreme Court \u2013 by a vote of 6-3 \u2013 deemed the scheme unconstitutional. A group of gun owners went to federal court in September to challenge the CCIA, arguing that the state had \u201cthumbed its nose\u201d at the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Bruen by creating a new scheme that was even more restrictive. In November, U.S. District Judge Glenn Suddaby agreed and barred the state from enforcing several key provisions of the CCIA.","Heller , 554 U. S., at 614. Of course, we are not obliged to sift the historical materials for evidence to sustain New York\u2019s statute. That is respondents\u2019 burden. A short prologue is in order. Even before the Civil War commenced in 1861, this Court indirectly affirmed the importance of the right to keep and bear arms in public.","Last year, the Supreme Court overhauled a long-standing New York law in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen and ruled Americans have the right to carry a firearm in public for self-defense. State lawmakers returned days later to strengthen New York's Red Flag Laws , which allow police to seize firearms of someone who is posing a danger to themselves or other people. Lawmakers last June also swiftly updated the state's concealed carry law limiting the public places where guns could be taken, and stricter requirements to obtain a concealed carry permit. SCOTUS' next gun rights decision, not expected until late spring 2024, will likely reinvigorate challenges to the state's emboldended Red Flag Law. A federal lawsuit is pending against the updated concealed carry law."]],"auto_evidence_url":[["https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2022\/06\/23\/supreme-court-strikes-down-new-york-gun-law-restricting-concealed-carry.html","https:\/\/www.uscourts.gov\/about-federal-courts\/educational-resources\/about-educational-outreach\/activity-resources\/about","https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2022\/06\/23\/supreme-court-strikes-down-new-york-gun-law-restricting-concealed-carry.html","https:\/\/law.stackexchange.com\/questions\/92761\/what-was-the-basis-reasoning-for-pennsylvanias-supreme-court-decision-to-declar","https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2022\/06\/23\/supreme-court-strikes-down-new-york-gun-law-restricting-concealed-carry.html"],["https:\/\/www.uscourts.gov\/about-federal-courts\/educational-resources\/supreme-court-landmarks","https:\/\/courses.lumenlearning.com\/suny-monroe-law101\/chapter\/how-the-united-states-and-new-york-state-constitutions-affects-our-lives\/","https:\/\/www.lwv.org\/blog\/understanding-supreme-courts-gun-control-decision-nysrpa-v-bruen","https:\/\/www.mtsu.edu\/first-amendment\/article\/1344\/john-marshall","https:\/\/courses.lumenlearning.com\/suny-monroe-law101\/chapter\/how-the-united-states-and-new-york-state-constitutions-affects-our-lives\/"],["https:\/\/ag.ny.gov\/press-release\/2023\/attorney-general-james-releases-statement-us-supreme-court-decision-allowing-0","https:\/\/www.law.cornell.edu\/supremecourt\/text\/20-843","https:\/\/www.scotusblog.com\/2023\/01\/court-allows-new-york-to-enforce-new-gun-control-law-while-legal-challenge-proceeds\/","https:\/\/www.law.cornell.edu\/supremecourt\/text\/20-843","https:\/\/spectrumlocalnews.com\/nys\/central-ny\/politics\/2023\/07\/10\/advocates--next-scotus-gun-rights-decision-will-clarify-ny-laws"]],"stance_claim_autoEvid":[["refute","refute","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant"],["irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant"],["irrelevant","completely-support","completely-support","irrelevant","irrelevant"]],"if_claim_needs_edit":["yes","yes","yes"],"claims_factuality_label":[false,false,false],"revised_claims":["The Supreme Court held that the New York state law was not constitutional.","The Supreme Court found that the New York state law was against the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution.","The Supreme Court found that the New York state law did unduly burden the right to keep and bear arms."],"usedEvidence_index_in_revision":["1","6","3"],"if_most_important_claim":["yes","intermediate","intermediate"]},"sentence4":{"text":"The decision was seen as a significant victory for gun control advocates and a setback for gun rights supporters.","decontext":"The decision on New York state rifle & pistol association, inc., ET AL. v.

They come from the loin which is the meat that runs from the pig\u2019s hip to its shoulder. While there are a variety of names for pork chops like loin, rib, sirloin, top loin, and blade chops, it\u2019s important to remember that they all cook the same. The length of cooking primarily depends on the thickness of the chop. Some prefer thin cut chops, but others prefer the juiciness of a thick-cut chop on the bone.","You will run across various types of pork chops when you visit the meat counter. Porterhouse Pork Chops are from the lower back (just behind the rib chop) and have a characteristic T-bone shape. These chops include a lot of meat as well as a bit of tenderloin meat. Ribeye Pork Chops originate in the center of the loin in the rib area and include some back and rib bone. Sirloin Pork Chops come from the area around the hip and often include part of the hip bone.","This lean, mild-flavored, and ultra-versatile cut of meat comes from the loin, the muscle that runs from the shoulder to the rear of the pig. (Other loin cuts you may know include the tenderloin, baby back ribs, and crown roast.) Take a trip to the butcher counter and you may notice two major types of pork chops \u2014 boneless and bone-in. Is one pork chop tastier or easier to cook than the other?","Because these chops are mostly loin meat with a small amount of rib meat, you get a satisfying mix of textures and flavors. When eating rib chops, be prepared to abandon your silverware, channel your inner barbarian, and tear off the rest of the meat with your teeth. That's really the best way to enjoy them. Center-Cut Pork Chops You can identify a center-cut pork chop \u2014 also called a loin chop or center loin chop \u2014 by the T-shaped bone that runs down the middle of it. On one side of this bone you'll find lighter loin meat, while on the other side you'll see darker tenderloin meat.","The blade chop, while less common, is another type of bone-in chop that comes from the shoulder end of the loin. You may also see sirloin chops, but these typically have more bone than meat and are tough unless braised. Pork Rib Chops This rib chop is what most of us envision when we think of pork chops\u2014and it's the most popular cut that our local butcher sells. The rib chop contains the curved rib bone, which you'll see along the side of this cut. (This is actually the same bone that makes up a rack of mouthwatering baby back ribs.)"],["Some of these writers were constructed of chromosome X material. Some were the color of dark chocolate.

Muscle can no longer use oxygen to generate ATP and turn to anaerobic glycolysis, a process that breaks down sugar without oxygen, to generate ATP from glycogen, a sugar stored in muscle. The breakdown of glycogen produces enough energy to contract the muscles, and also produces lactic acid. With no blood flow to carry the lactic acid away, the acid builds up in the muscle tissue. If the acid content is too high, the meat loses its water-binding ability and becomes pale and watery.","They happens because stress\u2014perhaps caused by handling or stunning\u2014affects the chemistry of the meat after death. Typically, the reddish color of meat is determined by myoglobin , an oxygen-binding protein in muscle cells, similar to the hemoglobin in your blood. The concentration of myoglobin determines the color of the meat\u2014that's why myoglobin-rich beef is deep red and myglobin-poor poultry characteristically white. When unstressed animals die, lactic acid builds up in the muscle cells, slowing their mitochondria activity. This leaves surplus oxygen (which would normally be consumed by the mitochondria) for myoglobin to bind with.","Yet from the moment of slaughter, irreversible chemical changes take place in the dead animal to create the meals we know. In fact, the journey from muscle to meat begins even before the slaughtering process. For instance, so-called \"pre-slaughter stress\" can dramatically affect meat quality . In pigs, this process is referred to as pale soft exudative meat, resulting in meat that is a very pale color and that tastes particularly acidic. In cattle and sheep, the equivalent is the self-explanatory Dark Firm and Dry Meat.","Freezing the carcass too soon after death keeps the proteins all bunched together, resulting in very tough meat. Aging allows enzymes in the muscle cells to break down the overlapping proteins, which makes the meat tender. Without ATP, actin and myosin remain locked in a permanent contraction called rigor mortis. When meat is heated, the bonds break and the protein molecule unwinds. Heat also shrinks the muscle fibers both in diameter and in length as water is squeezed out and the protein molecules recombine, or coagulate.","Excessive heat, dehydration, cramped conditions, and strange surroundings have a negative effect on most animals, with some finding the process more arduous than others. At the time of slaughter, animals are moved from their holding pens into a specially designed S-shaped approach chute that helps to keep the animals calm. This then leads the animal into a tight holding box where it is stunned, bled, then winched up for skinning, eviscerating, splitting, and washing followed by rapid cooling in a special holding cooler. Example: Grandin Livestock Handling System All the factors outlined above have some effect on the animal\u2019s pH. As the animal ceases to breathe, and as blood leaves the animal with the heart still pumping, about 50% of the blood is removed."]],"auto_evidence_url":[["https:\/\/www.doubtnut.com\/question-answer-biology\/where-are-chromosomes-found-in-a-cell-state-their-function-647288889","https:\/\/www.doubtnut.com\/question-answer-biology\/where-are-chromosomes-found-in-a-cell-state-their-function-647288889","https:\/\/www.vedantu.com\/question-answer\/are-the-chromosomes-found-in-a-cell-state-their-class-11-biology-cbse-5f3e01a166397e2b32ec95f1","https:\/\/www.doubtnut.com\/question-answer-biology\/where-are-chromosomes-found-in-a-cell-state-their-function-647288889","https:\/\/www.mountsinai.org\/health-library\/special-topic\/chromosome"],["https:\/\/annex.exploratorium.edu\/cooking\/meat\/INT-what-is-meat.html","https:\/\/massivesci.com\/articles\/how-do-muscles-become-meat\/","https:\/\/massivesci.com\/articles\/how-do-muscles-become-meat\/","https:\/\/annex.exploratorium.edu\/cooking\/meat\/INT-what-is-meat.html","https:\/\/opentextbc.ca\/meatcutting\/chapter\/chemical-changes-associated-with-slaughter\/"]],"stance_claim_autoEvid":[["completely-support","irrelevant","completely-support","irrelevant","irrelevant"],["irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant"]],"if_claim_needs_edit":["no","yes"],"claims_factuality_label":[true,false],"revised_claims":["Chromosomes are found in the cells of living organisms.","Once an animal is slaughtered, the cells begin to die."],"usedEvidence_index_in_revision":["-1","self-retrieved"],"if_most_important_claim":["intermediate","yes"]},"sentence3":{"text":"So, while a pig has 38 chromosomes in each of its cells, there are no chromosomes in a pork chop that you might buy at the grocery store or order at a restaurant.","decontext":"While a pig has 38 chromosomes in each of its cells, there are no chromosomes in a pork chop that you might buy at the grocery store or order at a restaurant.","sentence_factuality_label":false,"revised_decontext":"A pig has 38 chromosomes in each of its cells.

In the normal cell of a pig, or any mammal, chromosomes occur in distinct pairs. Pigs have 19 chromosome pairs for a total of 38 chromosomes (Figure 1). This contrasts with humans, who have 23 chromosome pairs for a total of 46. Since chromosomes occur in pairs, genes also exist in pairs.","Since pigs have 19 chromosome pairs, there are 524,288 (2 to the 19th power) different chromosomal arrangements that can occur during gamete development. With many different genes on each chromosome, the possible number of distinct assortments of genes in forming gametes is infinite. Therefore, the possible number of genetically different pigs can be much larger than the total number of pigs being raised on the nation's farms. Figure 2. Gamete formation and fertilization.","2. Classical Cytogenetics Conventional laboratory techniques applied to effectively view chromosomes under a light microscope are referred to as classical cytogenetics techniques. The diploid chromosome number of the pig is 2 n = 38, consisting of 18 autosomal chromosome pairs, which vary in length and morphology (12-bi-armed and 6 one-armed pairs), and two sex chromosomes, XX or XY [ 12 , 13 , 14 ]. The resulting technique was referred to as quinacrine fluorescence (QFQ), or Q-banding. RBA-banding employs the use of the protease trypsin similar to GTG, and acridine orange fluorochrome to stain euchromatic regions more intensely, resulting in a banding pattern that is the inverse of GTG-banding [ 25 , 26 , 28 ]. Although these banding patterns were initially developed for the examination of human chromosomes, these methods have been adapted for use on porcine chromosomes and are still routinely applied to the study of porcine chromosomes [ 5 , 29 ].","In these cases, the chromosomes fuse at the centromeric region, resulting in the production of two derivative chromosomes, a large bi-armed chromosome, and a secondary short chromosome often lost in subsequent cell divisions. Thus, the karyotype of a domestic pig carrying Robertsonian translocation has a distinct 2 n = 37 diploid chromosome number, with the noticeable addition of a novel large bi-armed chromosome. Tandem fusion occurs similarly to Robertsonian translocations; however, it instead involves the fusion of the telomeric region of one chromosome to the centromeric region of another. Tandem fusion is a rare event in the pig, with just one such rearrangement reported, 37, XY, der(14;17)(q29;q10) [ 58 ].","Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2008 , 120 , 26\u201341.

Summary The paper primarily focuses on the use of attention mechanisms in NLP tasks, such as machine translation, summarization, and language modeling. The authors argue that previous models have limitations in capturing long-term dependencies and require a significant amount of training data to achieve reasonable performance. To overcome these limitations, the authors proposed the Transformer model, which is based entirely on the attention mechanism. The Transformer model uses a self-attention mechanism that allows the model to attend to all positions in the input sequence to compute a representation of each position.","Attention Is All You Need (Q30249683) From Wikidata Jump to navigation Jump to search scientific article published in June 2017 Attention is All you Need edit Language Label Description Also known as English Attention Is All You Need scientific article published in June 2017 references references Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks 0 references Identifiers arXiv ID 1706.03762 arXiv classification cs.

Earth and all other objects in our solar system orbit around the Sun due to gravity \u2013 the Sun contains over 98% of all mass in the solar system and so exerts a strong gravitational pull. Like other stars, the Sun is a dense ball of gas that creates energy through nuclear fusion reactions in the core, creating helium atoms from hydrogen atoms. The Sun radiates different forms of energy, including ultraviolet, infrared, and light energy, out into space. Light and heat energy from the Sun warm our planet and make life possible.","Its spin has a tilt of 7.25 degrees with respect to the plane of the planets\u2019 orbits. Since the Sun is not solid, different parts rotate at different rates. At the equator, the Sun spins around once about every 25 Earth days, but at its poles, the Sun rotates once on its axis every 36 Earth days. Moons As a star, the Sun doesn\u2019t have any moons, but the planets and their moons orbit the Sun. Rings Rings","The Sun is a hot ball of glowing gases. It keeps our planet warm enough for living things to grow. It gives us light so we can see. The planets orbit the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

Why explore Mars Over the last century, everything we\u2019ve learned about Mars suggests that the planet was once quite capable of hosting ecosystems\u2014and that it might still be an incubator for microbial life today. Mars is the fourth rock from the sun, just after Earth.

Despite its smaller size, the planet\u2019s land area is also roughly equivalent to the surface area of Earth\u2019s continents \u2014meaning that, at least in theory, Mars has the same amount of habitable real estate. Unfortunately, the planet is now wrapped in a thin carbon dioxide atmosphere and cannot support earthly life-forms. Methane gas also periodically appears in the atmosphere of this desiccated world, and the soil contains compounds that would be toxic to life as we know it. Although water does exist on Mars, it\u2019s locked into the planet\u2019s icy polar caps and buried, perhaps in abundance, beneath the Martian surface .","Is there life on Mars?

Sweet ripe peaches surrounded by thick syrup and a flaky crust will turn the heads of even the most diehard dieters. Peach cobbler from Buckner's Family Restaurant in Jackson, Georgia"],["The top four states in peach production are California, South Carolina, Georgia and New Jersey. In 2017, California supplied nearly 56 percent of the United States fresh peach crop and more than 96 percent of processed peaches (NASS, 2021). United States total peach production in 2021 was 661,890 tons valued at $624 million. California led the nation in peach production, with 505,000 tons valued at $378.3 million. South Carolina followed, producing 87,400 tons (NASS, 2021).","The United States trails in peaches globally, producing only 5 percent of the world total. China, the native land of peaches, produces 45 percent of the world crop, according to Clemson Cooperative Extension . According to USDA reports, the top 10 peach-producing states in 2018 were, in order, California, South Carolina, New Jersey, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Washington, Michigan, New York and West Virginia, which put out 6,500 tons of the fruit. Last year, social media posts pitted rival peach-producers in the South. Despite growing fewer peaches than South Carolina, the Georgia Department of Agriculture said Georgia was the superior producer with sweeter fruits.","Historically, considerable peach production occurred in north Georgia also, but during the 1980s and 1990s acreage declined because of frequent freeze damage and relatively late harvest dates. Although Georgia is called the Peach State, it actually ranked third in United States peach production in 2012. California harvested 648,000 tons and South Carolina 69,650 tons making them the real peach states. Each year, Georgia produces more than 130 million pounds of peaches. In 2012, the Georgia peach crop totaled 35,250 tons, up more than 10,000 tons from 2008.","The central region is the largest with about 1.6 million peach trees and 75 percent of the state's production. The southern region produces about 30 million pounds of peaches annually. Georgia's peach industry is concentrated in Macon, Peach, Crawford and Taylor counties along the fall line, the transition zone between Georgia's Piedmont and Coastal Plain. This area is far enough north to receive sufficient winter chilling, but far enough south to avoid late frosts and guarantee early harvest dates. The early harvest allows premium prices for the crop.","Peaches have long been a Georgia trademark and are the state's official fruit. But what might not be so well known is that Macon County is the leading peach producing county in the state.

Moist, fertile soil that drains well is ideal for peach trees. A combination of loamy\/sandy soil of central Georgia, a blend of the Piedmont\u2019s clay and the Coastal Plain\u2019s sandy soils, is a great fit for peach production. Temperature is also important for peach trees and the tree\u2019s fruit production.","Georgia's latitude and longitude are 30\u00b0 N to 35\u00b0 N and 81\u00b0 W to 85\u00b0 W, and it neighbors the states of Alabama, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Georgia\u2019s temperate climate and soil types provide excellent growing conditions for a variety of agricultural goods, including cotton, soybeans, peanuts, pine trees and peaches. Although peaches are not native to Georgia, peaches are the official state fruit with over 40 varieties grown throughout the State. The state produces over 130 million pounds of peaches annually, with the harvest occurring between mid-May and mid-August.","That presents a challenging future for southern-grown peaches, fruit that needs a delicate balance of cold winter weather and temperate springs to grow successfully. Creating a more temperature-tolerant peach, says Gasic, is complex. Peaches can grow in Florida, after all, needing as few as 50 chill hours or none at all. But in Georgia, peaches must contend with a pretty reliable frost during the spring. \u201cThat is one of the mysteries of climate change in Georgia,\u201d says Knox.","\u201cWe\u2019re talking probably the second half of this century. Certainly by 2100 it could be a possibility,\u201d says Pam Knox, an agricultural climatologist at the University of Georgia. Georgia peaches need to chill The entire southeastern U.S. is warming, and the average winter temperature in Georgia has risen by five degrees Fahrenheit since 1960 . That warming trend is expected to continue, and peach trees need a minimum number of chilly hours for their spring buds to bear fruit. Every winter, when temperatures fall below 45\u00b0F, peach trees produce the hormones that tell them to go dormant.","Once a peach has enough chill hours, temperatures above 45\u00b0F begin to shake the trees out of dormancy like a seasonal alarm clock announcing that it\u2019s time to start making peaches. If exposed to enough warm weather, the tree\u2019s flowers start to develop and open. Some may even produce small fruitlets. But the tree needs to stay on that warming trajectory; when a spring frost hits, as it often does in Georgia, it can damage fruit that\u2019s already growing. \u201cWe already have a little fruit that is full of water,\u201d Gasic says of peaches that bloom early."],["They were traded along the Silk Road and made their way to Europe before eventually gracing American groves.

Berckmans Nursery was a hub for horticulture in the mid to late 1800s in Augusta . At the complex, the Berckmans family worked to develop breeds of peaches that would thrive in Georgia's climate, leading to Georgia's prosperous crops for generations.

But despite its associations with perfectly pink-orange peaches, \"The Peach State\" of Georgia is neither the biggest peach producing state (that honor goes to California) nor are peaches its biggest crop. So why is it that Georgia peaches are so iconic? The answer, like so much of Southern history, has a lot to do with slavery \u2014 specifically, its end and a need for the South to rebrand itself. Yet, as historian William Thomas Okie writes in his book The Georgia Peach , the fruit may be sweet but the industry in the South was formed on the same culture of white supremacy as cotton and other slave-tended crops.","There is a small commercial presence in Brooks and Pierce counties in south Georgia, where new varieties suitable for those areas are improving fruit quality. The new varieties seem to be responsible for a surge in the planting of peaches in this region of the state. Historically, considerable peach production occurred in north Georgia also, but during the 1980s and 1990s acreage declined because of frequent freeze damage and relatively late harvest dates. As many as 18 peach packing houses lined the streets of Fort Valley in the heyday of the peach industry.

Knowledge sharing : A fourth potential issue is ensuring knowledge sharing on the machine learning side across the organization. As you spread out your ML expertise, your ML personnel will be focused on solving the assigned problem. However, even if you have decentralized teams, it makes sense to have your ML engineers and data scientists across the organization meet regularly to align and discuss solutions to common problems shared across groups. A typical example of this is the development of MLOps practices that can be used in all teams to speed up the development of AI.","They will better understand what you need (and don\u2019t need) to integrate with it. Knowledge sharing : Your ML engineers and data scientists might help the rest of the team grasp and improve their knowledge of machine learning.

Instead of using the original signals of full sentences, we train a Transformer-based sequence encoder over a large set of short sequences, which allows the model to automatically select the most useful information for predicting masked words. Experiments on question answering and textual entailment tasks demonstrate that our pre-trained encoder can outperform state-of-the-art encoders trained with continuous sentence signals as well as traditional masked language modeling baselines. Our proposed approach also achieves new state of the art on HotpotQA (full-wiki setting) by improving intermediate information retrieval performance.","Only 15% of the practicing endodontists hold this board certification.

Explanation: - Aqua regia is a mixture of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and nitric acid (HNO3) in the ratio of 3:1. - Elemental gold (Au) is a noble metal and does not react with most acids, but it readily dissolves in aqua regia due to the presence of nitric acid, which oxidizes the gold to form Au3+ ions. - The Au3+ ions then react with the chloride ions (Cl-) from hydrochloric acid to form a complex ion called tetrachloroaurate (III) ion, [AuCl4]-. - The H+ ions from hydrochloric acid combine with the remaining nitrate ions (NO3-) from nitric acid to form nitric acid, HNO3. -","Can you explain this answer? Verified Answer The compound formed by dissolving elemental gold in aqua regia is:a)Au... Aqua regia is a mixture of conc. HNO3 and conc. HCl in the ratio 1:3.","Complete answer: Aqua regia is a mixture of hydrochloric acid ($HCl$) and nitric acid ($HN{O_3}$). It is able to dissolve gold because of the unique action of $HCl$ and $HN{O_3}$. As $HN{O_3}$ is a powerful oxidising agent, it converts gold to its ionic form ($A{u^{3 + }}$). $HCl$makes way for the chlorine anions to react with the gold cations in order to form tetrachloroaurate (III) anions in presence of these $A{u^{3 + }}$ ions in the solution.

Iron is a metal, an element of group VIII of the periodic table . It is a lustrous, ductile, malleable, silver-grey in colour. It is the tenth most abundant element in the universe.","Iron view talk edit | references Iron is a chemical element with the symbol Fe (from Latin ferrum 'iron') and atomic number 26. It is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table . It is, by mass, the most common element on Earth , just ahead of oxygen (32.1% and 30.1%, respectively), forming much of Earth's outer and inner core . It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust , being mainly deposited by meteorites in its metallic state, with its ores also being found there. Extracting usable metal from iron ores requires kilns or furnaces capable of reaching 1,500 \u00b0C (2,730 \u00b0F) or higher, about 500 \u00b0C (932 \u00b0F) higher than that required to smelt copper .","Iron is also the metal at the active site of many important redox enzymes dealing with cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals. [6] Chemically, the most common oxidation states of iron are iron(II) and iron(III) . Iron shares many properties of other transition metals, including the other group 8 elements , ruthenium and osmium . Iron forms compounds in a wide range of oxidation states , \u22124 to +7. Iron also forms many coordination compounds ; some of them, such as ferrocene , ferrioxalate , and Prussian blue have substantial industrial, medical, or research applications.","Pure iron is quite reactive. In a very finely divided state metallic iron is pyrophoric (i.e., it ignites spontaneously). Metallic iron dissolves readily in dilute mineral acids. With nonoxidizing acids and in the absence of air, iron in the +2 oxidation state is obtained. With air present or when warm dilute nitric acid is used, some of the iron goes into solution as the Fe 3+ ion.","[55] Its 26 electrons are arranged in the configuration [Ar]3d 6 4s 2 , of which the 3d and 4s electrons are relatively close in energy, and thus a number of electrons can be ionized. [13] Iron forms compounds mainly in the oxidation states +2 ( iron(II) , \"ferrous\") and +3 ( iron(III) , \"ferric\"). Iron also occurs in higher oxidation states , e.g., the purple potassium ferrate (K 2 FeO 4 ), which contains iron in its +6 oxidation state. The anion [FeO 4 ] \u2013 with iron in its +7 oxidation state, along with an iron(V)-peroxo isomer, has been detected by infrared spectroscopy at 4 K after cocondensation of laser-ablated Fe atoms with a mixture of O 2 \/Ar."]],"auto_evidence_url":[["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Iron(II)_sulfate","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Iron(II)_sulfate","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Iron(II)_sulfate","https:\/\/www.quora.com\/What-is-the-chemical-equation-and-formula-for-an-iron-reaction-with-copper-sulfate-that-forms-iron-II-sulfate-and-copper","https:\/\/www.quora.com\/Is-the-reaction-between-iron-sulphate-and-copper-possible"],["https:\/\/www.verywellhealth.com\/copper-sulfate-benefits-4684436#toc-how-to-use-copper-sulfate","https:\/\/www.vedantu.com\/question-answer\/change-in-color-is-observed-when-copper-sulfate-class-9-chemistry-cbse-5f5c41fb8f2fe249180431af","https:\/\/www.vedantu.com\/question-answer\/change-in-color-is-observed-when-copper-sulfate-class-9-chemistry-cbse-5f5c41fb8f2fe249180431af","https:\/\/www.pw.live\/question-answer\/what-is-the-colour-of-copper-sulphate-crystals-what-happens-when-it-52225","https:\/\/www.vedantu.com\/question-answer\/change-in-color-is-observed-when-copper-sulfate-class-9-chemistry-cbse-5f5c41fb8f2fe249180431af"],["https:\/\/chemistry.stackexchange.com\/questions\/12256\/which-ion-of-iron-is-produced-in-a-reaction-between-iron-and-copperii-sulfate","https:\/\/chemistry.stackexchange.com\/questions\/12256\/which-ion-of-iron-is-produced-in-a-reaction-between-iron-and-copperii-sulfate","https:\/\/chemistry.stackexchange.com\/questions\/12256\/which-ion-of-iron-is-produced-in-a-reaction-between-iron-and-copperii-sulfate","https:\/\/www.quora.com\/What-is-the-chemical-equation-and-formula-for-an-iron-reaction-with-copper-sulfate-that-forms-iron-II-sulfate-and-copper","https:\/\/www.quora.com\/Is-the-reaction-between-iron-sulphate-and-copper-possible"],["https:\/\/byjus.com\/chemistry\/iron\/","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Iron","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Iron","https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/science\/iron-chemical-element","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Iron"]],"stance_claim_autoEvid":[["irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant"],["completely-support","completely-support","completely-support","completely-support","irrelevant"],["irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant"],["completely-support","completely-support","completely-support","partially-support","irrelevant"]],"if_claim_needs_edit":["yes","no","yes","no"],"claims_factuality_label":[false,true,false,true],"revised_claims":["There is no resulting products of copper reacting with ferrous sulphate since there is no reaction","Copper sulfate is a blue solution.","Copper does not react with ferrous sulphate hence there are no resulting products.","Iron is a solid."],"usedEvidence_index_in_revision":["5","-1","5","-1"],"if_most_important_claim":["yes","no","yes","no"]}}}

Under the influence of the physicist Georg Friedrich Parrot, Struve developed an interest in the exact sciences, especially astronomy. In 1812 he began his first astronomical observations at Dorpat Observatory, and later he was appointed extraordinary professor of mathematics and astronomy as well as observer there.

Published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company.","Aluminium, for example, has a density of about 2.7 grams per cubic centimeter, but a piece of aluminium will float on top of quicksand until motion causes the sand to liquefy. [3] Continued or panicked movement, however, may cause a person to sink further in the quicksand. [4] Quicksand may be escaped by slow movement of the legs in order to increase viscosity of the fluid, and rotation of the body so as to float in the supine position (lying horizontally with the face and torso facing up).

As the sand dries, its structural integrity gets weaker. And when disturbed \u2014 by a person or other vibrations \u2014 it can collapse suddenly. If someone falls into that hole, it can quickly prove deadly. Saving 'property and lives': Why Ocean City is getting new round of beach replenishment Summer season: Ocean City businesses remain 'cautiously optimistic' about future amid COVID-19 What happens when sand collapses?","This is because once you've disturbed and temporarily liquefied the quicksand , you'll sink to around your waist or mid-chest level (if it is that deep). Once the sand grains in suspension begin to settle under gravity, they'll begin to compact around your submerged body parts \u2014 namely your legs. If you do attempt to aggressively free yourself, you will simply liquefy more sand, making your situation progressively worse the more you stress and strain to escape. Try to control your breathing too. If you breathe more deeply than usual, this will greatly increase your relative buoyancy and also doubles as a way to calm you down and think clearly.","This sudden \"shock\" disrupts the careful balance of sand and\/or clay or mud and water. This causes the body of sand to liquefy resulting in the water and particulate matter separating. This leaves a layer of densely packed wet sand that cannot support your weight and causes you to sink. This is primarily because the frictional forces between sand grains that would normally be able to resist your weight are temporarily lubricated. If you take our advice and stay calm, eventually the equilibrium of the quicksand will be restored, preventing you from sinking further.","( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Quicksand and a warning sign about it at a gravel quarry in England Quicksand on the Thames Quicksand , also known as sinking sand , is a colloid consisting of fine granular material (such as sand , silt or clay ) and water . It forms in saturated loose sand when the sand is suddenly agitated. When water in the sand cannot escape, it creates a liquefied soil that loses strength and cannot support weight. Quicksand can form in standing water or in upward flowing water (as from an artesian spring ).","The saturated sediment may appear quite solid until a sudden change in pressure or shock initiates liquefaction. This causes the sand to form a suspension and lose strength. The cushioning of water gives quicksand, and other liquefied sediments, a spongy, fluid-like texture. Objects in liquefied sand sink to the level at which the weight of the object is equal to the weight of the displaced soil\/water mix and the submerged object floats due to its buoyancy. Soil liquefaction may occur in partially saturated soil when it is shaken by an earthquake or similar forces."]],"auto_evidence_url":[["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Quicksand","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Quicksand","https:\/\/www.dictionary.com\/browse\/quicksand","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Quicksand","https:\/\/www.dictionary.com\/browse\/quicksand"],["https:\/\/goodnewsmag.org\/sinking-sand\/","https:\/\/goodnewsmag.org\/sinking-sand\/","https:\/\/goodnewsmag.org\/sinking-sand\/","https:\/\/science.howstuffworks.com\/environmental\/earth\/geology\/quicksand.htm","https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/future\/article\/20160323-can-quicksand-really-suck-you-to-your-death"],["https:\/\/www.delmarvanow.com\/story\/news\/2022\/05\/19\/toms-river-new-jersey-beach-death-dangers-sinkhole-sand-collapse\/9837563002\/","https:\/\/interestingengineering.com\/science\/quicksand-is-not-very-deadly","https:\/\/interestingengineering.com\/science\/quicksand-is-not-very-deadly","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Quicksand","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Quicksand"]],"stance_claim_autoEvid":[["completely-support","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant"],["irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","completely-support","completely-support"],["partially-support","completely-support","completely-support","completely-support","completely-support"]],"if_claim_needs_edit":["no","no","no"],"claims_factuality_label":[true,true,true],"revised_claims":["Sinking sand is also known as quicksand.","Sinking sand is a type of wet sand.","Sinking sand becomes liquefied and viscous when it is disturbed."],"usedEvidence_index_in_revision":["-1","-1","-1"],"if_most_important_claim":["yes","yes","yes"]},"sentence2":{"text":"It can cause a person or object to become trapped and sink rapidly.","decontext":"Sinking sand can cause a person or object to become trapped and sink rapidly.","sentence_factuality_label":true,"revised_decontext":"It can cause a person or object to become trapped and sink rapidly.","sentence_checkworthiness":"yes","most_importance_sentence":"no","claims":["Sinking sand can cause a person or object to become trapped.","Sinking sand can cause a person or object to sink rapidly."],"claim_checkworthiness":["factual","factual"],"if_automatic_evidence_enough_to_verify":["yes","yes"],"human_evidence":["NA","NA"],"auto_evidence":[["Researchers in the Netherlands and France studied quicksand, a combination of fine sand, clay, and salt water.

The first written mention of the potato is a receipt for delivery dated 28 November 1567 between Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Antwerp . In France, at the end of the 16th century, the potato had been introduced to the Franche-Comt\u00e9 , the Vosges of Lorraine and Alsace .

Recipe Origin Madrid, Spain, claims a signature on Patatas Bravas, which is never missing on the menu at any known tapas. The dish dates back to 1542 after Spain concurred with the Inca Empire to bring back their agricultural produce, such as tomatoes.","The origin of \u201cPatatas Bravas\u201d The \u201cPatatas Bravas\u201d are potatoes accompanied by hot sauce. In fact, its name comes from the spicy cayenne, which is essential in the sauce. Potatoes can be prepared fried, cooked in water, cooked in oil and even in some cases baked.

The tomato was introduced to Europe in the 16th century by Spanish conquistadors who traveled to South America. The tomato was formerly viewed with suspicion by Europeans, who thought it was harmful because of its connection to the deadly nightshade plant. Nonetheless, it was swiftly incorporated into European cuisine, and it gained more and more traction. Almost 200 million tons of tomatoes are produced annually, making it one of the most frequently grown crops in the world today.","Mar 24 -- Share The roots of the tomato are said to be in the Andes area, which includes modern-day Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. The tomato\u2019s history is strongly anchored in South America. The tomato was first mentioned in writing around 500 BC, when the ancient civilizations of Peru and Ecuador began to cultivate the fruit for its therapeutic benefits. About 700 AD, in what is now Mexico, the Aztecs are thought to have started cultivating tomatoes. To describe the tomato, the Aztecs used the term \u201cxitomatl,\u201d which translates as \u201cplump object with a navel.\u201d","The tomato\u2019s development from a food crop in ancient South America to a staple in modern society is evidence of its continuing appeal and significance. Salads, sandwiches, soups, stews, pasta sauces, and many more meals all employ tomatoes, which are a fruit that is highly adaptable. They are prized for their vivid color, smooth texture, and juicy, slightly sweet flavor. Given their ease of cultivation and great global demand, tomatoes are a crucial crop for both farmers and consumers.

Both scouts reported to Columbus two days later that they had met Indians transporting large quantities of cinnamon reeds.","When most people think of chilis , they think of Indian curry or exotic Thai dishes, but for most of Human history the delicious family of peppers was only found in the New World. Chilis were domesticated in Mexico a little more than 6,000 years ago, making them one of the earliest crops domesticated in the Americas. The colorful littler peppers were used to add flavor to meals and also for medicinal purposes. Cultivation of chilis spread to South America within only a few centuries.

The immediate results of these efforts were often not very great. For example, many African governments and merchants were no more inclined than many European or American governments or merchants to enforce or to observe the anti-slave-trade treaties that British officials wished upon them.","The trans-Atlantic slave trade was an international industry, which meant that international cooperation was required to enforce abolition once national bans were in place. In the early nineteenth century, many governments representing former slaving powers signed multi-national anti-slave trade treaties. Britain provided the largest and most effective anti-slave trade fleet , but France, Portugal, and the United States also manned lightly-armed flotillas. In addition, most powers recognized a newly established network of international courts designed to adjudicate illegal slave trading cases, known as the Courts of Mixed Commission . By the mid-nineteenth century, these courts were established in Brazil, the Caribbean, West Africa, and South Africa.","British ships had been by far the largest carriers of slaves at the end of the 18th century, and only Britain really possessed the naval resources necessary to secure enforcement of anti-slave-trade laws on the high seas . Furthermore, when Portugal , Spain , and some American countries expanded their slave trading to meet the deficiency caused by the British withdrawal, they met with strong opposition from Britain. The underlying reason for this was that Britain, more than any other European nation, had considerable amounts of capital, experience, and goodwill accumulated in trade with Africa. Economic interest therefore combined with abstract morality to induce successive British governments to bring pressure on other governments to outlaw their slave trades and to permit the British navy to help enforce their laws on their ships at sea. But these measures did not stop the export of slaves from Africa.","Underdeveloped plantation economies in these jurisdictions created huge demand for slave labor and record profits for illegal slave traders. Most Brazilian and Cuban policymakers linked economic growth with continued slave imports, and many tacitly supported the illegal traffic. Similarly, in Africa, polities with long slave-trading histories such as Dahomey and Ngoyo were unwilling or unable to halt the supply of captives to the coast, or to expel foreign slave dealers who resided there, despite commitments to do both. Meanwhile, the illegal slave trade became increasingly difficult to suppress. British and American merchants engaged indirectly in the traffic by supplying Latin American slave traders with ships and goods exchangeable for captives on the African coast.","However, it also stated that both countries should try to intercept slavers in the Atlantic Ocean. The Webster-Ashburton Treaty, signed on August 9, 1842, defines the common anti-slaving goals between Britian and the United States, declaring both parties will equip and maintain vessels expressly for the purpose of patrolling the coast of Africa.

On the economic front, slavery and the slave trade had become increasingly marginal to the livelihoods of many northerners, which weakened their resistance to the abolition of the slave trade. At the same time, in the Upper South, politically influential slaveholders supported abolition in order to strengthen the domestic slave trade to Lower South. These planters believed that if the trans-Atlantic trade was not abolished, it would compete with the domestic traffic in supplying slaves to the Lower South, where plantations were expected to flourish in the nineteenth century. \"Palaver with the Queen of Ambrizette,\" painting by Francis Meynell , 1855, courtesy of the National Maritime Museum , London, United Kingdom.","The trans-Atlantic slave trade was an international industry, which meant that international cooperation was required to enforce abolition once national bans were in place.

For example, many African governments and merchants were no more inclined than many European or American governments or merchants to enforce or to observe the anti-slave-trade treaties that British officials wished upon them.","For example, many African governments and merchants were no more inclined than many European or American governments or merchants to enforce or to observe the anti-slave-trade treaties that British officials wished upon them.","The trans-Atlantic slave trade was an international industry, which meant that international cooperation was required to enforce abolition once national bans were in place. In the early nineteenth century, many governments representing former slaving powers signed multi-national anti-slave trade treaties. Britain provided the largest and most effective anti-slave trade fleet , but France, Portugal, and the United States also manned lightly-armed flotillas. In addition, most powers recognized a newly established network of international courts designed to adjudicate illegal slave trading cases, known as the Courts of Mixed Commission . By the mid-nineteenth century, these courts were established in Brazil, the Caribbean, West Africa, and South Africa."]],"auto_evidence_url":[["https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/place\/western-Africa\/The-abolition-of-slavery","https:\/\/ldhi.library.cofc.edu\/exhibits\/show\/voyage-of-the-echo-the-trials\/historic-context--abolishing-t","https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/place\/western-Africa\/The-abolition-of-slavery","https:\/\/ldhi.library.cofc.edu\/exhibits\/show\/voyage-of-the-echo-the-trials\/historic-context--abolishing-t","https:\/\/www.history.navy.mil\/content\/history\/museums\/nmusn\/explore\/prior-exhibits\/2020\/anti-slave-trade-patrols.html"],["https:\/\/ldhi.library.cofc.edu\/exhibits\/show\/voyage-of-the-echo-the-trials\/historic-context--abolishing-t","https:\/\/ldhi.library.cofc.edu\/exhibits\/show\/voyage-of-the-echo-the-trials\/historic-context--abolishing-t","https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/question\/How-did-the-Industrial-Revolution-change-economies","https:\/\/www.history.navy.mil\/content\/history\/museums\/nmusn\/explore\/prior-exhibits\/2020\/anti-slave-trade-patrols.html","https:\/\/slaveryandremembrance.org\/articles\/article\/?id=A0002"],["https:\/\/ldhi.library.cofc.edu\/exhibits\/show\/voyage-of-the-echo-the-trials\/historic-context--abolishing-t","https:\/\/www.history.navy.mil\/content\/history\/museums\/nmusn\/explore\/prior-exhibits\/2020\/anti-slave-trade-patrols.html","https:\/\/www.history.navy.mil\/content\/history\/museums\/nmusn\/explore\/prior-exhibits\/2020\/anti-slave-trade-patrols.html","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-business-slavery-un\/companies-thwarting-global-drive-to-end-forced-labor-by-2030-experts-idUSKBN1HI3A6","https:\/\/ldhi.library.cofc.edu\/exhibits\/show\/voyage-of-the-echo-the-trials\/historic-context--abolishing-t"],["https:\/\/ldhi.library.cofc.edu\/exhibits\/show\/voyage-of-the-echo-the-trials\/historic-context--abolishing-t","https:\/\/ldhi.library.cofc.edu\/exhibits\/show\/voyage-of-the-echo-the-trials\/historic-context--abolishing-t","https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/place\/western-Africa\/The-abolition-of-slavery","https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/place\/western-Africa\/The-abolition-of-slavery","https:\/\/ldhi.library.cofc.edu\/exhibits\/show\/voyage-of-the-echo-the-trials\/historic-context--abolishing-t"]],"stance_claim_autoEvid":[["partially-support","partially-support","partially-support","irrelevant","irrelevant"],["partially-support","partially-support","partially-support","irrelevant","irrelevant"],["partially-support","partially-support","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant"],["irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant"]],"if_claim_needs_edit":["no","no","no","not_enough_evidence"],"claims_factuality_label":[true,true,true,"unknown"],"revised_claims":["The anti-slave treaties contributed to the development of new economies in Africa.","The anti-slave treaties contributed to the development of new economies based on industries such as palm oil.","The anti-slave treaties contributed to the development of new economies based on industries such as rubber.","The anti-slave treaties contributed to the development of new economies based on industries such as mining."],"usedEvidence_index_in_revision":["-1","-1","-1","-1"],"if_most_important_claim":["yes","yes","yes","yes"]},"sentence2":{"text":"These industries replaced the slave trade as a primary source of profit for European traders.","decontext":"Palm oil, rubber, and mining industries replaced the slave trade as a primary source of profit for European traders.","sentence_factuality_label":true,"revised_decontext":"These industries replaced the slave trade as a primary source of profit for European traders.","sentence_checkworthiness":"yes","most_importance_sentence":"no","claims":["Industries such as palm oil, rubber, and mining replaced the slave trade as a primary source of profit for European traders."],"claim_checkworthiness":["factual"],"if_automatic_evidence_enough_to_verify":["yes"],"human_evidence":["NA"],"auto_evidence":[["The answer is \"no\"; slavery did not create a major share of the capital that financed the European industrial revolution. The combined profits of the slave trade and West Indian plantations did not add up to five percent of Britain's national income at the time of the industrial revolution. Nevertheless, slavery was indispensable to European development of the New World. It is inconceivable that European colonists could have settled and developed North and South America and the Caribbean without slave labor. Moreover, slave labor did produce the major consumer goods that were the basis of world trade during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries: coffee, cotton, rum, sugar, and tobacco.","By the end of the nineteenth century, working class diet was transformed by calories from sugar, and Europe was re-clothed in cotton, reducing, although not eliminating wool, silk and linen. Guns. The most direct link between the developing metalworking and guns industry in Britain and slavery was the trade in guns in exchange for slaves in West Africa. From the mid-eighteenth century until the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, a staggering total of nearly 20 million muskets, over half of which were British, were sold in exchange for slaves, the rest from other European nations. The annual export of gunpowder likewise grew from 200,000 lbs in 1750 to two million lbs at its peak in 1791.","Much of the historical debate about British capitalism and slavery has concerned the importance of profits from the \u2018triangular trade\u2019 between Britain, Africa (slaves), and the Caribbean sugar plantations. The role of these profits as a pump-primer for the industrial revolution has been largely confirmed , now with an additional emphasis on the attendant significance of banking, insurance and development of financial services. But the perspective needs broadening further, both in time and geographical space. Although never of huge significance or scale as a manufacturing industry, by the end of the nineteenth century, sugar had become a major source of calories in working class diets. In addition to bread, by weight, wage workers bought more sugar than fats, and nearly as much as meat.","The importation of European textiles , according to some historians, spurred the industrialization of the European textile industry while harming African cloth producers, who could not compete on quantity or price. Weavers continued to produce goods for local markets, but no continent-wide market for African textiles ever had an opportunity to develop because Europeans already dominated the field. There were similar consequences for the African metal industry. These effects have been long-lasting. One scholar has demonstrated that the areas from which the most enslaved people were taken are today the poorest in Africa, though at the time of the slave trade they were among the most developed.","The trade in both sugar and enslaved people sustained numerous industries and employed thousands of people, creating great wealth for some. Shipbuilders, ship captains, and sailors found employment, as did dock workers, freight drivers, customs agents, and workers in sugar refineries. Bakers, pastry cooks, candy makers, and grocers all indirectly made money from sugar. People who made the barrels that held sugar and the other products produced by enslaved people\u00e2\u0080\u0094tobacco, rice, and indigo\u00e2\u0080\u0094profited, as did those who supplied inexpensive clothing, shoes, and foodstuffs like salted fish for enslaved people. Banks and insurance companies earned enormous sums as well, and those who owned large sugar plantations often invested their profits in other industries, built magnificent mansions, or bought luxury goods."]],"auto_evidence_url":[["https:\/\/www.gilderlehrman.org\/history-resources\/teaching-resource\/historical-context-was-slavery-engine-american-economic-growth","https:\/\/www.historyworkshop.org.uk\/empire-decolonisation\/slavery-coerced-labour-and-the-development-of-industrial-capitalism-in-britain\/","https:\/\/www.historyworkshop.org.uk\/empire-decolonisation\/slavery-coerced-labour-and-the-development-of-industrial-capitalism-in-britain\/","https:\/\/openstax.org\/books\/world-history-volume-2\/pages\/5-4-the-atlantic-slave-trade","https:\/\/openstax.org\/books\/world-history-volume-2\/pages\/5-4-the-atlantic-slave-trade"]],"stance_claim_autoEvid":[["completely-support","completely-support","completely-support","partially-support","partially-support"]],"if_claim_needs_edit":["no"],"claims_factuality_label":[true],"revised_claims":["Industries such as palm oil, rubber, and mining replaced the slave trade as a primary source of profit for European traders."],"usedEvidence_index_in_revision":["-1"],"if_most_important_claim":["yes"]},"sentence3":{"text":"European traders were now more interested in exploiting Africa's natural resources rather than its people.","decontext":"European traders were now more interested in exploiting Africa's natural resources rather than its people.","sentence_factuality_label":"NA","revised_decontext":"European traders were now more interested in exploiting Africa's natural resources rather than its people.","sentence_checkworthiness":"opinion","most_importance_sentence":"no","claims":[],"claim_checkworthiness":[],"if_automatic_evidence_enough_to_verify":[],"human_evidence":[],"auto_evidence":[],"auto_evidence_url":[],"stance_claim_autoEvid":[],"if_claim_needs_edit":[],"claims_factuality_label":[],"revised_claims":["European traders were now more interested in exploiting Africa's natural resources rather than its people."],"usedEvidence_index_in_revision":[],"if_most_important_claim":[]},"sentence4":{"text":"Additionally, the abolitionist movement in Europe led to an increased demand for African raw materials.","decontext":"The abolitionist movement in Europe led to an increased demand for African raw materials.","sentence_factuality_label":true,"revised_decontext":"Additionally, the abolitionist movement in Europe led to an increased demand for African raw materials.","sentence_checkworthiness":"yes","most_importance_sentence":"no","claims":["The abolitionist movement in Europe led to an increased demand for African raw materials."],"claim_checkworthiness":["factual"],"if_automatic_evidence_enough_to_verify":["yes"],"human_evidence":["NA"],"auto_evidence":[["In 1807, England forbade all slave trade and the British Parliament voted slavery out in 1833.

The abolitionist movement, often supported by Freemasonry and Protestant milieus, grew into a strong Europe-wide network through the federation of national branches and the organisation of large congresses in the 1880s.

Supporters and critics often engaged in heated debates and violent\u2014 even deadly\u2014confrontations. The divisiveness and animosity fueled by the movement, along with other factors, led to the Civil War and ultimately the end of slavery in America.","The abolitionist movement was an organized effort to end the practice of slavery in the United States.

Abolitionists underlined the responsibility of regulationism and its brothels which provided a huge opportunity for pimps. The opening of military brothels during the First World War reflects the failure of abolitionism. Only revolutionary Russia abolished regulationism but, from 1929, it harshly repressed prostitutes, considered deviants and interned in forced re-education centres.

Furthermore, when Portugal , Spain , and some American countries expanded their slave trading to meet the deficiency caused by the British withdrawal, they met with strong opposition from Britain. The underlying reason for this was that Britain, more than any other European nation, had considerable amounts of capital, experience, and goodwill accumulated in trade with Africa. Economic interest therefore combined with abstract morality to induce successive British governments to bring pressure on other governments to outlaw their slave trades and to permit the British navy to help enforce their laws on their ships at sea.

[6] Background [ edit ] Watts-Russell had founded 4AD in 1980, and the label established itself as one of the key labels in the British post-punk movement.","[1] This led to the characteristic Cocteau Twins sound: Fraser's voice, by turns ethereal and operatic, combined with increasingly effects-heavy guitar playing by Guthrie [1] (who has often said that he is far more interested in the way the guitar is recorded than in the actual notes being played, though he later admitted that his reliance on effects and layering was initially due to his own technical limitations). [14] In 1983 the band participated in 4AD's This Mortal Coil project, which spawned a cover version of Tim Buckley 's \" Song to the Siren \" (performed by Guthrie and Fraser). Despite appearing under the This Mortal Coil name, the cover has subsequently become one of the best-known Cocteau Twins tracks. During the TMC sessions, Guthrie and Fraser became acquainted with another project contributor, multi-instrumentalist Simon Raymonde (formerly a member of Drowning Craze ), who joined Cocteau Twins later that year.","The 4AD website said: This Mortal Coil was not a band, but a unique collaboration of musicians recording in various permutations, the brainchild of 4AD kingpin Ivo Watts-Russell. The idea was to allow artists the creative freedom to record material outside of the realm of what was expected of them; it also created the opportunity for innovative cover versions of songs personal to Ivo. One of the label's earliest signings was Modern English . In 1983, Watts-Russell suggested that the band re-record two of its earliest songs, \"Sixteen Days\" and \"Gathering Dust\", as a medley. At the time, the band was closing its set with this medley, and Watts-Russell felt it was strong enough to warrant a re-recording.","This Mortal Coil at trouserpress.com v t e This Mortal Coil Ivo Watts-Russell John Fryer Studio albums It'll End in Tears (1984) Filigree & Shadow (1986) Blood (1991) Singles Sixteen Days\/Gathering Dust \" Song to the Siren \" Compilations 1983\u20131991 Related 4AD The Hope Blister ...","These included The Spangle Maker (1984), Treasure (1984), Aikea-Guinea (1985), Tiny Dynamine (1985), Echoes in a Shallow Bay (1985), and Love's Easy Tears (1986).

Raymonde returned to the group for The Moon and the Melodies (1986), a collaboration with ambient composer Harold Budd , [1] which was not released under the Cocteau Twins name. In 1985 4AD signed an agreement with Relativity Records for distribution of Cocteau Twins releases in the US and other territories.

The Moon and the Melodies (4AD, 1986) was the result of a collaboration with the late minimalist ambient composer and musician Harold Budd. It was originally intended to be the soundtrack to a documentary film produced by the BBC.","What\u2019s the difference between This Mortal Coil and Cocteau Twins? This Mortal Coil was a collaborative project organized by Ivo Watts-Russell, the co-founder of 4AD Records. The idea was to have artists from various bands on 4AD work together on a blend of original projects and cover versions of older songs. One of the early recordings in the project was a cover of the ballad (made famous by Tim Buckley), \u201cSong to the Siren,\u201d which was performed by Robin and Liz and released as a single. It was eventually included on the first This Mortal Coil LP, It\u2019ll End in Tears (1984)."],["This Mortal Coil - Song To The Siren I love the haunting, atmospheric, ethereal, ghostly, otherworldly, dreamy kind of sound that both of these songs has (even though they were released 30 years apart).... what else would i like that's like this? Read more","I\u2019m not prepared for anything when I walk into the studio. It\u2019s just like a na\u00efve search for a sound \u2013 a na\u00efve attempt at a thought I\u2019ve had to combine sounds. With \u2018Filigree And Shadow\u2019 (the second This Mortal Coil album), it was really very much music from around 1969 that I was listening to. You can do anything and have that in your mind all the time. Anything can happen.","This Mortal Coil Origin United Kingdom Genres Dream pop [1] gothic rock [2] [3] Years active 1983\u20131991 Labels 4AD Past members Ivo Watts-Russell John Fryer This Mortal Coil were a British music collective led by Ivo Watts-Russell , founder of the British record label 4AD . [5] The project became known for its gothic, dream pop sound, and released three full albums, beginning in 1984 with It'll End in Tears .","Shoegaze aimed to bury the vocals over production effects and a heavy guitar, to subvert the typical melody-heavy music of the time. In the 1980s, U.K.-based record label 4AD signed a collection of bands that would become known as early pioneers of dream pop, including the Cocteau Twins, This Mortal Coil, and Dead Can Dance. The label's carefully curated roster was full of layered, often feminine vocals and moody melodies, but its aesthetic cohesion came across through intricate vinyl packaging. 4AD\u2019s record sleeves were full of dark and dreamy swirls and negative space, which Beach House later employed to fit their own sound across 11 years and seven albums, keeping them consistent. Shoegaze and dream pop had plenty of overlap in the late 1980s and 1990s.","I'm not sure. There are a couple catchy synth riffs, and a kinda catchy vocal section, but... eh... it's not particularly inspiring. Besides, some of the pieces are just plain throwaways. In short, Blood simply demonstrates that the age of This Mortal Coil is passing. Still, pretty high quality background music it is."]],"auto_evidence_url":[["https:\/\/www.viberate.com\/artist\/this-mortal-coil\/","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/This_Mortal_Coil","https:\/\/www.viberate.com\/artist\/this-mortal-coil\/","https:\/\/starlingdb.org\/music\/thismc.htm","https:\/\/www.viberate.com\/artist\/this-mortal-coil\/"],["https:\/\/arcane-delights.com\/2022\/10\/26\/ivo-watts-russell-4ad-interview-1988\/","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/This_Mortal_Coil","https:\/\/cocteautwins.com\/cocteau-twins-faq.html","https:\/\/starlingdb.org\/music\/thismc.htm","https:\/\/cocteautwins.com\/cocteau-twins-faq.html"],["https:\/\/thequietus.com\/articles\/25725-strange-world-this-mortal-coil-4ad-reissues","https:\/\/www.factmag.com\/2011\/01\/26\/rockwell-takes-on-this-mortal-coil-and-untold\/","https:\/\/thequietus.com\/articles\/25725-strange-world-this-mortal-coil-4ad-reissues","https:\/\/cocteautwins.com\/cocteau-twins-faq.html","https:\/\/cocteautwins.com\/cocteau-twins-faq.html"],["https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ifyoulikeblank\/comments\/7ypgsa\/iil_destrooy_by_spooky_black_song_to_the_siren_by\/","https:\/\/arcane-delights.com\/2022\/10\/26\/ivo-watts-russell-4ad-interview-1988\/","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/This_Mortal_Coil","https:\/\/www.afterglowatx.com\/blog\/2022\/2\/2\/the-sound-of-music-beach-house-and-the-reimagination-of-dreampop","https:\/\/starlingdb.org\/music\/thismc.htm"]],"stance_claim_autoEvid":[["partially-support","irrelevant","partially-support","irrelevant","irrelevant"],["partially-support","irrelevant","irrelevant","partially-support","partially-support"],["irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant"],["irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","partially-support"]],"if_claim_needs_edit":["no","no","no","no"],"claims_factuality_label":[true,true,true,true],"revised_claims":["The music of This Mortal Coil was characterized by the layers of sound.","The layers of sound in the music of This Mortal Coil was created by lush, dreamy vocal harmonies.","The layers of sound in the music of This Mortal Coil was created by reverb-drenched guitars.","The layers of sound in the music of This Mortal Coil was created by ethereal synthesizer textures."],"usedEvidence_index_in_revision":["-1","-1","-1","-1"],"if_most_important_claim":["yes","intermediate","intermediate","intermediate"]}}}

See What dosage of magnesium should I take? to read more about recommended daily dosages for adults and children.","But this important mineral can only perform its functions in the body properly if you get your individual daily requirement of magnesium. On average, an adult requires around 300 to 400 mg magnesium per day. The precise amount depends on many factors, such as age, sex or life situation (e.g. pregnancy). Magnesium requirement throughout life The figures for women\u2019s magnesium requirement are based on the recommendation by the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Ern\u00e4hrung (German Nutrition Society). Magnesium requirement throughout life Figures for men\u2019s magnesium requirement are based on the recommendation by the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Ern\u00e4hrung (German Nutrition Society).","There\u2019s no scientific evidence to point to any risks associated with taking magnesium supplements during pregnancy, or later when breastfeeding. In fact, the recommended daily dosage for pregnant women increases from 375 mg to 400 mg for supplements taken by mouth. Again, with transdermal magnesium supplements, there is no maximum dose. Is it possible to take too much magnesium? At present, there\u2019s little clinical evidence to show that taking high doses of magnesium over a long period of time can be harmful."],["Total magnesium intake is usually dependent on caloric intake, which explains the higher intake levels seen in the young and in adult males and the lower levels seen in women and in the elderly. Water is a variable source of intake; typically, water with increased \u201chardness\u201d has a higher concentration of magnesium salts. Since this varies depending on the area from which water comes, much like fluoride, and the manner in which it is stored, magnesium intake from water is usually not estimated except in controlled diet studies. This omission may lead to underestimating total intake and its variability. Intake from Supplements Based on a national survey in 1986, 14 percent of men and 17 percent of women in the United States took supplements containing magnesium ( Moss et al., 1989 ).","The recommended amount differs depending on your age and sex. Women ages 19 to 30 should aim for 310 milligrams (mg) per day, then 320 mg a day after age 31. Men 19 to 30 should aim for 400 mg per day, then 420 mg per day after age 31. Pregnant and breast-feeding women will require slightly more. Read More How Much Magnesium Do I Need?","Indicators Used to Set the EAR in Women Balance Studies. The only study in females for this age group was part of the year-long study of dietary intakes of men and women, which included an estimation of magnesium balance in 10 women aged 25 to 53 years ( Lakshmanan et al., 1984 ). The average magnesium intake was 231 \u00b1 80 mg (9.6 \u00b1 3.3 mmol)\/day. Four subjects were in positive or zero balance, while six were in negative balance, which suggests that 231 mg (9.6 mmol)\/day is probably less than is necessary to prevent magnesium loss in 50 percent of women ages 31 through 50 years. Thus, the average requirement for women ages 31 through 50 years appears to be somewhat higher than 231 mgs (9.6 mmol)\/day.","But according to dietary surveys, many American adults still aren\u2019t getting the magnesium they need. In fact, nearly half are consuming less than the estimated average requirement of this important mineral. The good news is that with a little careful planning, you should be able to get the magnesium your body needs \u2014 400 to 420 milligrams per day for adult men and 310 to 320 milligrams for women (more if pregnant or breastfeeding). What does magnesium do in the body? Magnesium is necessary for many of the body\u2019s cellular functions.","The results showed that women receiving either level of magnesium did not develop pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia; among those not receiving supplements, 97 cases (2 percent) occurred. Women with the higher intake of magnesium had a lower incidence of intrauterine growth retardation than did women with the lower intake. Three prospective trials of magnesium supplementation during pregnancy have been conducted ( Table 6-5 ). In the first two studies, women were supplemented with magnesium aspartate- hydrochloride containing 365 mg (15.2 mmol)\/day of magnesium. In the third study, women were supplemented with magnesium citrate, which provided a daily magnesium average intake of 170 to 340 mg (7.1 to 14.2 mmol)."],["Systemic inflammation , which contributes to the development of metabolic disorders, has been inversely correlated with magnesium intakes in a cross-sectional study of 11,686 women (\u226545 years). In this study, the lowest prevalence of metabolic syndrome was found in the group of women in the highest quintile of magnesium intakes (median intake, 422 mg\/day) (20) . Several randomized controlled trials also reported a reduction in circulating C-reactive protein (CRP) \u2014 a marker of inflammation \u2014 following oral magnesium supplementation (21) . This might constitute a potential mechanism through which magnesium could play a role in the prevention of metabolic disorders. Cardiovascular disease Hypertension (high blood pressure)","How much magnesium do women need? To support this wide range of roles, Public Health England recommend that adults should aim to consume 300mg daily. Dietary sources: Magnesium can be found naturally in many different foods but in small quantities. To meet this, each meal should have at least 3 magnesium containing foods to help achieve a realistic daily intake. Fortunately, certain wholefoods are rich in magnesium such as oats and barley or the pseudocereals buckwheat and quinoa.","Some studies have found lower magnesium content and larger hydroxyapatite crystals in bones of women with osteoporosis compared to disease-free women (74) . Higher dietary magnesium intakes have been associated with increased site-specific (77) and total-body BMD (78) in observational studies , including studies of older adults. More recently, a large cohort study conducted in almost two-thirds of the Norwegian population found the level of magnesium in drinking water to be inversely associated with the risk of hip fracture (79) . Moreover, the highest versus lowest quintile of total magnesium intakes was associated with a 23% increased risk of lower arm and wrist fractures (80) . Few studies have addressed the effect of magnesium supplementation on BMD or osteoporosis in humans.","The recommended amount differs depending on your age and sex. Women ages 19 to 30 should aim for 310 milligrams (mg) per day, then 320 mg a day after age 31. Men 19 to 30 should aim for 400 mg per day, then 420 mg per day after age 31. Pregnant and breast-feeding women will require slightly more.

After getting this base vocabulary, we add new tokens until the desired vocabulary size is reached by learning merges , which are rules to merge two elements of the existing vocabulary together into a new one.

Bulk RNA sequencing is the method of choice for transcriptomic analysis of pooled cell populations, tissue sections, or biopsies. It measures the average expression level of individual genes across hundreds to millions of input cells and is useful to get a global idea of gene expression differences between samples. At Single Cell Discoveries, we can offer normal and low-input bulk RNA sequencing with our sample multiplexing protocol. We use CEL-seq2-type barcodes to uniquely label each sample and subsequently pool (multiplex) samples together for library preparation.","Skip to main content Toggle navigation Main navigation Texture Analysis How it works Products Method examples Fixtures About Us Contact Language Bulk Analysis The bulk analysis texture testing method is commonly applied to particular products (eg reconstituted meats) or foodstuffs containing small elements in a mouthful or serving (eg rice or beans).

Introduction Bulk RNA-seq experiments typically measure total gene expression from heterogeneous tissues, such as tumor and blood samples 1 , 2 . Variability in cell-type composition can significantly confound analyses of these data, such as in identification of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) or differentially expressed genes 3 . Cell-type heterogeneity may also be of interest in profiling changes in tissue composition associated with disease, such as cancer 4 or diabetes 5 . In addition, measures of cell composition can be leveraged to identify cell-specific eQTLs 6 , 7 or differential expression 6 from bulk data.","In observed bulk expression, our reference-based method accurately estimates cell proportions that are consistent with previously reported distributions and reliably detects rare cell types. We found that these estimates consistently follow expected trends with measured phenotypes, suggesting that cell-specific estimates of proportion are sufficiently accurate to extract relevant biological signals. In addition, differences in tissue structure can lead to significant differences in the quality of single-cell expression data 33 . We demonstrated the improved performance of our method in adipose and DLPFC, two distinct tissues, suggesting that Bisque is robust across different tissue types. With this reference-based approach, single-cell sequencing of a subset of samples from large-scale bulk expression cohorts can provide high power to detect cell-specific associations in complex phenotypes and diseases.","We present Bisque, a highly efficient tool to measure cellular heterogeneity in bulk expression through robust integration of single-cell information, accounting for biases introduced in the single-cell sequencing protocols. The goal of Bisque is to integrate the different chemistries\/technologies of single-cell and bulk tissue RNA-seq to estimate cell-type proportions from tissue-level gene expression measurements across a larger set of samples. Our reference-based model decomposes bulk samples using a single-cell-based reference profile and, while not required, can leverage single-cell and bulk measurements for the same samples for further improved decomposition accuracy. This approach employs gene-specific transformations of bulk expression to account for biases in sequencing technologies as described above. We demonstrate using simulated and real datasets from brain and adipose tissue that our method is significantly more accurate than existing methods."],["Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis of bulk tissue is a common approach to decipher underlying mechanisms, though this can obscure cell-type specific signals thus masking trait-relevant mechanisms. While single-cell sequencing can be prohibitively expensive in large cohorts, computationally inferred cell type proportions and cell type gene expression estimates have the potential to overcome these problems and advance mechanistic studies. Using bulk RNA-Seq from 1,730 samples derived from whole blood in a cohort ascertained for individuals with BP and SCZ this study estimated cell type proportions and their relation with disease status and medication. We found between 2,875 and 4,629 eGenes for each cell type, including 1,211 eGenes that are not found using bulk expression alone. We performed a colocalization test between cell type eQTLs and various traits and identified hundreds of associations between cell type eQTLs and GWAS loci that are not detected in bulk eQTLs.","Running a Bulk Analysis can be greatly beneficial to your marketing plan for a number of reasons.

Single-cell sequencing has recently been adopted by multiomic strategies, which bring together simultaneous information about different molecular modalities and their relationship in individual cells. Multiomics combines the assessment of cellular features pertaining to the genome (e.g., chromatin accessibility, copy-number variations), the transcriptome, the proteome and, more recently, spatial patterns of gene expression. Such a multiomic approach overcomes the drawback of correlative integration of unimodal datasets obtained from separate experiments ( Ma Anjun et al., 2020 ) and identifies key molecular features within individual cells.

They can show the differences and evolutionary relationships of various cells. Traditional sequencing methods can only get the average of many cells, unable to analyze a small number of cells and lose cellular heterogeneity information. Compared with traditional sequencing technology, single-cell technologies have the advantages of detecting heterogeneity among individual cells [ 1 ], distinguishing a small number of cells, and delineating cell maps.","Thus, both tissue-specific and measurement-specific aspects of obtaining multi-omics measurements need to be considered in order to achieve optimized single cell suspensions. Next, the technique used to select single cells after separation of bulk tissues also has an impact on the feasibility of combinatorial multi-omics measurements. The advantages of techniques such as mouth pipetting and serial dilution include the simplicity and rapidity of moving single cells from the cell suspension to individual reaction chambers. This helps limit the degradation of more volatile molecules such as RNA or protein and may reduce the possibility of non-physiologic changes in chromatin accessibility and chromatin conformation ( Wang and Navin, 2015 ; Svensson et al., 2017 ). Of the numerous options, selection of a protocol for isolating single cells for multi-omics data collection will ultimately depend on the molecules that need to be preserved, the type of tissue obtained, and the cost."],["Multiomics offers the sensitivity to potentially detect rare variants and provide more data in less time.

At 70 m depth, a diver breathes a gas mixture with a total pressure of 8.6 atm. What is the partial pressure of each gas in the tanks? 02:39 A scuba diver that ascends to the surface too quickly can experience decompression sickness, which occurs when nitrogen dissolves in the blood under high pressure, forms bubbles as the pressure decreases during the ascent.","When you go diving, you breathe a mix of gases, like oxygen, nitrogen, and, in tec diving, sometimes helium. Each gas adds to the total pressure, but they also have their own individual pressure. This is known as partial pressure and is each gas\u2019 part of the total pressure. Furthermore, while diving, you\u2019re exposed to water pressure, in addition to the air pressure on the surface. The pressure on Earth\u2019s surface is one atmosphere of pressure (1 ata).","By learning about the type of gas in scuba tanks, you can better prepare yourself for your next diving adventure.

Gas density reduces respiratory efficiency, leading to CO2 retention, and becomes an issue when it exceeds 6g per liter, which is reached at 36m\/120ft when breathing air. Most major recreational dive agencies do not teach gas density management. Some agencies do teach it and apply a 30m\/100ft limit to air\/nitrox diving and use helium mixtures beyond that.","This 1.4 ppO2 limit equates to a 56.6m\/185ft maximum depth when breathing air (21% O2). Read more about Oxygen toxicity in this article: Oxygen Exposure Management For Divers Gas Density The issue of Gas Density and its role in CO2 retention ( hypercapnia ) is woefully under-educated by many scuba training agencies. Gas density has been well studied and it is proven that a greater density of breathing gas reduces respiratory efficiency that leads to CO2 retention. Studies by the US Navy Experimental Dive Unit (NEDU) have illustrated a huge uptake in CO2 retention when breathing gas density exceeds 6g per litre.","Are you curious about how deep you can safely dive using air? While diving with air is a popular choice for recreational divers, there are three key factors that limit the depth you can reach. These factors are: Nitrogen narcosis CNS oxygen toxicity Gas density In this article, I will explore each of these factors in detail and explain why they\u2019re important for divers to understand. From the impact of nitrogen narcosis to the role of gas density in CO2 retention, I will provide you with valuable insights to help you stay safe on your next deep dive.

Scuba is an acronym for S elf C ontained U nderwater B reathing A pparatus. Most scuba divers are recreational divers who explore underwater environments such as lakes, rivers, quarries, kelp forests and coral reefs. There are also people who scuba dive for work including public safety divers , marine biologists and many others.","Is scuba diving safe? With the right training, scuba diving is considerably safer than other popular activities. Statistics show you\u2019re more likely to get injured fishing, playing golf, snowboarding or even bowling than scuba diving. The most common medical issues associated with scuba diving are sunburn, seasickness , and dehydration (all of which are preventable).

(2 points) B.","They are all required for any divers. When you experience diving or start an OW course, you are definitely using compressed air, which is 21% oxygen, 79% nitrogen, and a small amount of helium (just like air). Later, even when we became nitrox divers, the gas in the tank was called nitrox air, not nitrox. Remember when you try to dive in the cave or dive at night, you usually need the canister dive light or some best dive lights for murky water.

Examples of these are trombe walls and other technologies as skylights . Passive solar heating can heat most buildings in even the mild and chilly climates. In colder climates, extra construction costs can be as little as 15% more than new, conventional buildings. In warm climates, those having less than two weeks of frosty nights per year, there is no cost impact.","Autonomy for all building applications From lighting and HVAC to security and occupancy monitoring, autonomous buildings use autonomy in all building systems. Incorporating autonomy into all systems improves building efficiency and reduces waste for a more sustainable building. For example, autonomous HVAC systems adjust temperature and airflow based on occupancy and environmental factors. Autonomous security systems streamline access control policies through connected IoT devices. How are these buildings sustainable?","We can offer standard and custom design solutions for autonomous systems using OptoTEC\u2122 OTX\/HTX or HiTemp ETX thermoelectric coolers, offering superior operation at elevated temperatures. OptoTEC\u2122 OTX\/HTX Series With a footprint smaller than 13X13 mm, the OptoTEC\u2122OTX\/HTX Series offers high heat pumping capacity for its size, making it ideal for autonomous applications with tight geometric space constraints. Assembled with next generation material the OTX\/HTX thermoelectric coolers boosts cooling capacity over standard product offerings while delivering a higher coefficient of performance. The OptoTEC Series is offered in two versions; OTX and HTX. While the OptoTEC OTX uses SbSn solder, enabling a maximum operating temperature of 120\u00b0C, the OptoTEC HTX thermoelectric cooler uses AuSn solder which allows it to survive in temperatures up to 150\u00b0C.","These cutting-edge buildings symbolize our growing commitment to reducing our carbon footprint and creating a more sustainable future for ourselves and future generations. Autonomous buildings definition Autonomous buildings refer to structures designed for operational independence from external power grids and water systems. They generate their own energy from renewable sources, store it in batteries, and use automation technology to manage their systems. This leads to energy independence and reduced reliance on traditional energy sources. What is an example of a self-sufficient building?","Packing more functionality into smaller footprints has increased the heat flux density and thermal challenges in autonomous systems. Designing active cooling systems that feature thermoelectric coolers will provide a thermal management solution needed to operate each sensitive device within its temperature range and optimize its performance.

However, because of their customary character, they may be applied to sustain the general principle of precaution in internal armed conflicts.","\u00bb Albert Camus.

The terrorist attacks against the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 further complicated the issue of war powers shared between the President and Congress. After September 11, the United States Congress passed the Authorization for Use of Military Force against Terrorists (AUMF). When the United States invaded Afghanistan, the U.S. military rounded up alleged members of the Taliban and those fighting against U.S. forces. The military then placed these \"detainees\" at a U.S. base located at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba at the direction of the Bush Administration who designed the plan under the premise that federal court jurisdiction did not reach the base.","\u25b8 International Criminal Court \u25b8 War crimes\/Crimes against humanity Indiscriminate or Disproportionate Attacks Humanitarian law prohibits any kind of indiscriminate attacks.

(2) The incidental civilian loss or damages must be proportionate with the military advantages.","The President prescribes procedural rules and punishments for violations of crimes in the Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM). Investigations of serious offenses involving military personnel such as rape, indecent assault, drugs, or larceny are usually conducted by a criminal investigative agency, such as the Army's Criminal Investigation Command (CID). For less serious offenses and most military-connected crimes, the authority rests with military or security police investigators. In cases involving very minor offenses, the immediate commander of the military member suspected will conduct or cause to be made a preliminary inquiry. Lawyers, known as judge advocates, are actively involved in advising commanders throughout the process."],["Some cited advantages satisfy tenets of green building , not independence per se (see below). Off-grid buildings often rely very little on civil services and are therefore safer and more comfortable during civil disaster or military attacks.

For robots, this could prove an insurmountable challenge. Advocates and critics of autonomous weaponry disagree over whether such systems can be equipped with algorithms sufficiently adept to distinguish between targets to satisfy the laws of war. 12 Another danger arises from the speed with which automated systems operate, along with plans for deploying autonomous weapons systems in coordinated groups, or swarms.

Such weathers are also forcing herders, who have been caring for goats for generations, to the cities as they cannot afford the loss of their livestock at such a scale. This can lead to culture loss and poverty as rural communities increasingly move into cities in search of economic opportunities. In recent years, the cashmere industry has faced multiple sustainability challenges with respect to climate change and the impact of goat herds on the environment. However, such developments have caused the industry to take stock and implement sustainable processes that not only protect the industry, but the environment too.","Like animal agriculture , cashmere production is contributing to climate change in a way that threatens its own existence. The effects of cashmere farming should be of wider public concern. A study published in Conservation Biology in 2013 linked the grazing of goats for the global cashmere trade to the decline of several large mammal species native to Central Asia. Grazing goats can alter soil by trampling, leading to more runoff and erosion.

A handicap is a race where each horse is allocated a weight, according to its ability, in an attempt to equalise every horse\u2019s chance of winning. Handicaps are run on the flat and over jumps. Handicapping is based on the idea that the weight a horse carries ultimately affects the speed at which it will gallop. A better horse will carry a heavier weight because the handicapper thinks they have more ability to win races.","A handicap race in horse racing is a race in which horses carry different weights, allocated by the handicapper. A better horse will carry a heavier weight, to give it a disadvantage when racing against slower horses. The skill in betting on a handicap race lies in predicting which horse can overcome its handicap. [1] Although most handicap races are run for older, less valuable horses, this is not true in all cases; some great races are handicaps, such as the Grand National steeplechase in England and the Melbourne Cup in Australia. In the United States over 30 handicap races are classified as Grade I, the top level of the North American grading system .","A handicapped race is one in which all participants' abilities are leveled, so that every participant, regardless of speed, has an equal chance at being the winner. Of course, there's an if. \"Every participant, regardless of speed, has an equal chance at being the winner ... IF they are honest about their abilities.\" That's a big \"if;\" because it's easy to fudge and then just pretend you were having a good day.","If you were to handicap this race, your goal would be to make it so that Joe, Megan and Steve would really be fighting at the finish line to be the first across. Sometimes, the handicapping is done just by giving the slower runners a \"head start.\" In this instance, Steve would start first, followed by Megan two and half minutes later, then Joe would start five minutes after Steve. In other situations, the handicapping is done based on a comparison to \"the best\" at the given distance . This is the basis behind age-grading or gender-grading race times.","How does a horse get a handicap mark? Every horse racing jurisdiction has an official handicapping body that's responsible for providing official ratings for every horse in training. In Britain it\u2019s done by the British Horse Racing Association (BHA). Usually the handicapper calculates this initial handicap mark by looking at the horse\u2019s performance in relation to the other horses in the race that already have official ratings. For example: Horse 1 is racing in his third race and wins, beating Horse 2 (rated 75) by four lengths."]],"auto_evidence_url":[["https:\/\/trove.nla.gov.au\/newspaper\/article\/29887189","https:\/\/primotipo.com\/tag\/1932-australian-grand-prix\/","https:\/\/forums.autosport.com\/topic\/1097-australian-gp-in-former-days\/","https:\/\/forums.autosport.com\/topic\/1097-australian-gp-in-former-days\/","https:\/\/forums.autosport.com\/topic\/1097-australian-gp-in-former-days\/"],["https:\/\/www.thejockeyclub.co.uk\/the-racing\/racing-explained\/jump-racing\/handicap-race\/","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Handicap_(horse_racing)","https:\/\/www.oregonlive.com\/runoregon\/2009\/07\/how_a_handicapped_race_works.html","https:\/\/www.oregonlive.com\/runoregon\/2009\/07\/how_a_handicapped_race_works.html","https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/betting\/racing\/what-is-a-handicap-in-horse-racing\/"]],"stance_claim_autoEvid":[["completely-support","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant"],["irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant"]],"if_claim_needs_edit":["no","not_enough_evidence"],"claims_factuality_label":[true,"unknown"],"revised_claims":["The 1932 Australian Grand Prix was a handicap race.","Handicap race allowes slower cars to start ahead of faster ones."],"usedEvidence_index_in_revision":["-1","-1"],"if_most_important_claim":["yes","yes"]},"sentence4":{"text":"The race was won by driver Bill Thompson driving a Bugatti Type 37A.","decontext":"The 1932 Australian Grand Prix was won by driver Bill Thompson driving a Bugatti Type 37A.","sentence_factuality_label":true,"revised_decontext":"The race was won by driver Bill Thompson driving a Bugatti Type 37A.","sentence_checkworthiness":"yes","most_importance_sentence":"no","claims":["The driver Bill Thompson won the 1932 Australian Grand Prix.","Bill Thompson drove a Bugatti Type 37A when he won the 1932 Australian Grand Prix."],"claim_checkworthiness":["factual","factual"],"if_automatic_evidence_enough_to_verify":["no","no"],"human_evidence":["The race, in which there were 18 starters,[3] was won by Bill Thompson driving a Bugatti.[1] Thompson was also awarded the Herald Trophy for recording the fastest time of the race.[1]\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/1932_Australian_Grand_Prix#:~:text=The%20race%2C%20in%20which%20there,fastest%20time%20of%20the%20race.","The race, in which there were 18 starters,[3] was won by Bill Thompson driving a Bugatti.[1] Thompson was also awarded the Herald Trophy for recording the fastest time of the race.[1]\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/1932_Australian_Grand_Prix#:~:text=The%20race%2C%20in%20which%20there,fastest%20time%20of%20the%20race."],"auto_evidence":[["Australian Grand Prix Winner 1930, 1932 and 1933.

Part 2 - Construction and Materials in Surfboard Fin Design Futures Fins giving us a look at the mold for their Alpha Fins . Alpha fins are made up of a carbon fiber compound that is strong and light. The same way surfboard combinations and design are endless, so are surfboard fin combinations and choices. It\u2019s only through experimentation that the best performing fins are going to be found and with so many aspects like materials, construction, cores and design able to be adjusted, it\u2019s no wonder great discoveries are still being made.","So how could fins get more hightech? This is where we start to play around with things like cores and high grade materials like carbon and kevlar. Performance Core Fins You can make the core of a surfboard fin out of almost any material you want. The most popular core going around high performance fins at the moment is generally a honeycomb\/hexagonal design that's made from lightweight and extremely strong materials. This type of design provides a unique stiffness and flex pattern through the fin in a super lightweight construction.","It was surfer Bob Simmons who reshaped surf culture by combining foam with wood and fiberglass and also creating the first double-fin surfboard. So, what are surfboard fins made of? Let\u2019s find out! Surfboard Fins Over the decades, surfboard fins evolved as surfers experimented with new shape designs and materials. So, what are fins on a surfboard made of today?","There are shortboards today that have three or even four fins. What Difference Does Surfboard Fin Material Have for Surfing? Different fin materials offer different levels of flexibility. Certain surfboard fin composites and sizes allow for more drastic maneuvers depending on your surfing style when working down the wave . For the more flow-style surfers on longboards or round-nose boards, a single plastic or wooden-resin fin offers more rigidity which is best for smaller and slower breaking waves.","Smaller fins for shortboards tend to flex more as they are made for a faster and more angular ride. Since smaller surfboard fins today are made primarily of a combination of resin, fiberglass, or various rubber compounds, the fin flexibility brings your ride to a new level when pumping up and down the wave. Choosing the Right Fin for your Board There is no right or wrong fin system, but you want to match the fin size to your board size. A longboard fin can work on a shortboard if it fits, but the maneuverability may seem funky, and depending on your skill level, you may have trouble riding with such an awkward fin setup. If you ride a longboard, a single thruster fin is the best route to take, and some board styles even allow for triple fin setups on a longboard."]],"auto_evidence_url":[["https:\/\/blog.wetsuitwearhouse.com\/why-do-surfboards-have-fins\/","https:\/\/www.theinertia.com\/surf\/the-definitive-guide-to-surfboard-fins\/","https:\/\/blog.wetsuitwearhouse.com\/why-do-surfboards-have-fins\/","https:\/\/blog.wetsuitwearhouse.com\/why-do-surfboards-have-fins\/","https:\/\/www.theinertia.com\/surf\/the-definitive-guide-to-surfboard-fins\/"],["https:\/\/thegromlife.com\/surfing\/what-are-surf-fins-made-of\/","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Surfboard_fin","https:\/\/usedsurf.com\/blog\/there-are-way-better-options-then-the-plastic-surfboard-fins-you-are-riding\/","https:\/\/thegromlife.com\/surfing\/what-are-surf-fins-made-of\/","https:\/\/thegromlife.com\/surfing\/what-are-surf-fins-made-of\/"]],"stance_claim_autoEvid":[["irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant"],["partially-support","irrelevant","irrelevant","completely-support","completely-support"]],"if_claim_needs_edit":["no","no"],"claims_factuality_label":[true,true],"revised_claims":["The fins help control the board in the water.","The fins for surfboard are typically made of plastic or fiberglass."],"usedEvidence_index_in_revision":["-1","-1"],"if_most_important_claim":["no","intermediate"]},"sentence5":{"text":"Some surfboards also have a layer of foam on the deck, which provides padding and grip for the surfer.","decontext":"Some surfboards also have a layer of foam on the deck, which provides padding and grip for the surfer.","sentence_factuality_label":true,"revised_decontext":"Some surfboards also have a layer of foam on the deck, which provides padding and grip for the surfer.","sentence_checkworthiness":"yes","most_importance_sentence":"intermediate","claims":["Some surfboards have a layer of foam on the deck.","The layer of foam on the deck provides padding and grip for the surfer."],"claim_checkworthiness":["factual","factual"],"if_automatic_evidence_enough_to_verify":["yes","yes"],"human_evidence":["NA","NA"],"auto_evidence":[["The outer layer is where the distinctions begin. Foamies, the gentle, cushiony surfboards evolved from boogie boards, are topped with an additional layer of foam material. As soft top technology has evolved, a new class of hybrid-style boards have emerged that replace the mushy foam deck with a thin layer of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or epoxy resin. This allows for more advanced design and maneuverability without sacrificing the easygoing, fun-forward characteristics of the soft top. Which Is Right For You?","The decks utilize a non-slip, irradiation cross-linked polyethylene (IXPE) foam that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s renowned for its compression resistance and grip.

Keep in mind some foam boards have more texture on the deck so you won't need as much wax and the amount can be applied to meet your needs.

Do note, that the foam decks of these surfboards make you prone to rash, so you might want to wear a rash guard like a T-shirt or surf shirt when paddling out. How to Wax a Foam Surfboard?","If you're a surfer without a foamy or soft top in your quiver, you're missing out. What is a Foam Surfboard? Standard, non-foam top surfboards are shaped with a foam blank and then covered in fibreglass. To put it simply, foam surfboard is used to describe surfboards that are not covered in fibreglass. There are plenty of names for foam surfboards, including soft top surfboards, softboards and foamies to name a few.","Sure, you can pick up a cheap foamie at Costco for a hundred bucks, but not all foam surfboards are created equal and there is one particular feature that should sway your decision while shopping for your next soft top\u2026. - > No-Wax Deck Pads!

Deval Patrick invested state funds to help make Massachusetts a center for biotech , Healey said she wants to make the state a center of renewable energy technology. A former Harvard basketball player, Healey said she has relied on teamwork as attorney general and will bring that same sense of a shared mission into the governor\u2019s office. Healey is hoping to work closely with the Democrat-controlled Massachusetts House and Senate. Democratic Senate President Karen Spilka delivered the oaths of office to Healey and Driscoll. \u201cNo matter what challenges we face, no matter what lies ahead, we will stay true to the best of ourselves,\u201d Healey said.","The ceremony also marks the first time that an all-women ticket will occupy the office. Kim Driscoll, who served as mayor of Salem, was elected lieutenant governor with Healey and was also sworn in on Thursday. Healey outlined some of her goals in her 35-minute inaugural address. She acknowledged the soaring cost of housing in Massachusetts and vowed in her first 100 days to create a new secretary of housing. She said she\u2019ll also work to convert state-owned property into homes or rental properties and reduce costs for renters by expanding tax breaks.","Log In to... In to... Log In to...

AI language translation tools also facilitate communication and collaboration among students from different linguistic backgrounds. Accessibility and Inclusion : AI technologies can improve accessibility for students with disabilities. For example, AI-powered text-to-speech and speech-to-text systems assist students with visual impairments or reading difficulties.","AI engineering is foundational for enterprise delivery of AI solutions at scale. The discipline creates coherent enterprise development, delivery, and operational AI-based systems. Autonomic systems are self-managing physical or software systems performing domain-bounded tasks that exhibit three fundamental characteristics: autonomy, learning and agency.

Stuart Russell is a Professor of Computer Science and the Director of the Center for Intelligent Systems at UC Berkeley and Author (with Peter Norvig) of Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach . He says: \u201cThe primary concern is not spooky emergent consciousness but simply the ability to make high-quality decisions . Here, quality refers to the expected outcome utility of actions taken, where the utility function is, presumably, specified by the human designer. Now we have a problem:","Whether or not we think some AI machines are already conscious or that they could (either by accident or by design) become conscious, this issue is a key source of ethical controversy. Thomas Metzinger (2013), for example, argues that society should adopt, as a basic principle of AI ethics, a rule against creating machines that are capable of suffering. His argument is simple: suffering is bad, it is immoral to cause suffering, and therefore it would be immoral to create machines that suffer. Again, this might all depend on what we understand by consciousness. Accordingly, Eric Schwitzgebel and Mara Garza (2015: 114\u201315) comment, \u2018If society continues on the path towards developing more sophisticated artificial intelligence, developing a good theory of consciousness is a moral imperative\u2019.","Stuart Jonathan Russell OBE (born 1962) is a British computer scientist known for his contributions to artificial intelligence (AI).

Artificial intelligence poses several real-life risks to individuals across the class spectrum in the United States, including economic uncertainty and legal trouble. For example, in February 2023, Getty Images, one of the world's largest online photography companies, filed a lawsuit against Stability AI, a popular text-to-machine learning generator. AI is largely unregulated by the federal government, however, Getty's lawsuit could potentially set the legal framework for machine learning via the court system.","This technology has the power to change the world, said Stuart Russell, a UC Berkeley computer science professor and leading AI expert.

The ship was towed to Crow Bay and later repaired. News of the event would be overshadowed a few days later by the sinking of RMS Lusitania but the incident, together with the attack on Lusitania and another ship, Cushing , formed the basis of a formal complaint from the US government to Germany."]],"auto_evidence_url":[["https:\/\/military-history.fandom.com\/wiki\/SM_UB-30","https:\/\/m.famousfix.com\/list\/u-boats-commissioned-in-1914","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SM_U-30_(Germany)","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SM_U-30_(Germany)#Torpedoing_of_Gulflight","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SM_U-30_(Germany)"],["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SM_U-30_(Austria-Hungary)#Service_career","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SM_U-30_(Germany)","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SM_U-30_(Germany)","https:\/\/www.das-werk-models.com\/products\/german-u-boat-sm-u9\/","http:\/\/dbpedia.org:8891\/page\/SM_U-30_(Austria-Hungary)"],["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SM_U-30_(Germany)","https:\/\/www.das-werk-models.com\/products\/german-u-boat-sm-u9\/","https:\/\/uboat.net\/types\/viia.htm","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SM_U-30_(Germany)","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SM_U-30_(Germany)"]],"stance_claim_autoEvid":[["irrelevant","irrelevant","completely-support","completely-support","irrelevant"],["refute","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","refute"],["irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant"]],"if_claim_needs_edit":["no","yes","yes"],"claims_factuality_label":[true,false,false],"revised_claims":["The SM U-30 German submarine was commissioned on December 22, 1914.","The SM U-30 German submarine had a displacement of 265 metric tons (261 long tons) when surfaced.","The SM U-30 German submarine had a displacement of 878 tons (864 long tons) when submerged."],"usedEvidence_index_in_revision":["-1","1,5","self-retrieved"],"if_most_important_claim":["yes","yes","yes"]},"sentence3":{"text":"The U-boat was armed with four 50cm torpedo tubes and a 88 mm deck gun.","decontext":"The SM U-30 was armed with four 50cm torpedo tubes and a 88 mm deck gun.","sentence_factuality_label":true,"revised_decontext":"The U-boat was armed with four 50cm torpedo tubes and a 88 mm deck gun.","sentence_checkworthiness":"yes","most_importance_sentence":"yes","claims":["The SM U-30 German submarine was armed with four 50cm torpedo tubes.","The SM U-30 German submarine was armed with a 88 mm deck gun."],"claim_checkworthiness":["factual","factual"],"if_automatic_evidence_enough_to_verify":["no","no"],"human_evidence":["4 \u00d7 50 cm (19.7 in) torpedo tubes \nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SM_U-30_(Germany)","Armament\t\n4 \u00d7 50 cm (19.7 in) torpedo tubes\n1 \u00d7 8.8 cm (3.5 in) SK L\/30 deck gun\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SM_U-30_(Germany)"],"auto_evidence":[["[2] SM U-30 [Note 1] was one of 329 U-boat submarines serving in the Imperial German Navy in World War I .

The earliest substantive evidence for cattle domestication anywhere in the world is the Pre-Pottery Neolithic cultures in the Taurus Mountains. The highest diversity of genetics in cattle is in the Taurus Mountains. A gradual decline in overall body size of aurochs, a characteristic of domestication, is seen at several sites in southeastern Turkey, beginning as early as the late 9th at Cayonu Tepesi.

These sites date to not long after the invention of farming and are in the region where cattle were first domesticated. The team examined how small differences in the DNA sequences of those ancient cattle, as well as cattle living today, could have arisen given different population histories. Using computer simulations they found that the DNA differences could only have arisen if a small number of animals, approximately 80, were domesticated from wild ox (aurochs).

As above, its lift-to-drag ratio. Very casually speaking this is just a measure of how \"aerodynamic\" the airplane is, comparing its capability to generate lift with the drag it creates in the process. The better its lifting capabilities, or the less drag it generates, the higher the ratio. For more information, I highly recommend a free online book on aerodynamics called See How It Flies by John Denker.","Glide angle and glide ratio are fundamental concepts for glider pilots, who rely solely on unpowered flight for their operations. Flight Planning: Pilots utilize glide angle and glide ratio calculations when planning fuel-efficient routes, maximizing the aircraft\u2019s gliding capabilities to save fuel and optimize flight times. Improving Glide Angle and Glide Ratio: Weight Reduction: Minimizing unnecessary weight on board enhances the aircraft\u2019s glide performance, improving both glide angle and glide ratio. Aerodynamic Modifications:","The Boeing 767 that lost all power attained a glide ratio of about 12 to 1 in practice. Airplanes generally do not use this to save fuel. It's much more efficient just to fly the airplane normally, or at low power if they are looking to conserve fuel. To glide would require turning the engine on and off. That is not efficient in jets, turboprops or piston engines.","The parameter you're asking about is called glide ratio and it is directly related to another parameter called lift-to-drag ratio or L\/D ratio . This is a fundamental characteristic of the aerodynamics of a particular aircraft. L\/D ratio varies with airspeed; for determining best engine-out glide performance, the L\/D ratio at \"best glide airspeed\" is used. \"Best glide airspeed\" is the speed that maximizes the L\/D ratio, and this maximum value is known as L\/D max . The maximum L\/D ratio (L\/D max ) of a Cessna 172 is about 9, so its glide ratio is about 9:1 - for every 9 units traveled forward it will lose 1 unit of altitude."]],"auto_evidence_url":[["https:\/\/www.aviationfile.com\/understanding-glide-angle-and-glide-ratio-exploring-the-key-concepts\/","https:\/\/aviation.stackexchange.com\/a\/3001","https:\/\/www.aviationfile.com\/understanding-glide-angle-and-glide-ratio-exploring-the-key-concepts\/","https:\/\/aviation.stackexchange.com\/a\/3001","https:\/\/aviation.stackexchange.com\/a\/3001"]],"stance_claim_autoEvid":[["completely-support","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant"]],"if_claim_needs_edit":["no"],"claims_factuality_label":[true],"revised_claims":["Airplane glide ratio refers to the distance an airplane can travel forward in relation to the altitude it loses during a gliding descent."],"usedEvidence_index_in_revision":["-1"],"if_most_important_claim":["yes"]},"sentence2":{"text":"It is expressed as a ratio, with higher numbers indicating that the airplane can travel further while losing less altitude.","decontext":"Airplane glide ratio is expressed as a ratio, with higher numbers indicating that the airplane can travel further while losing less altitude.","sentence_factuality_label":true,"revised_decontext":"It is expressed as a ratio, with higher numbers indicating that the airplane can travel further while losing less altitude.","sentence_checkworthiness":"yes","most_importance_sentence":"yes","claims":["Airplane glide ratio is expressed as a ratio.","in airplane glide ratio, Higher numbers in the ratio indicate that the airplane can travel further.","In airplane glide ratio, Higher numbers in the ratio indicate that the airplane loses less altitude."],"claim_checkworthiness":["factual","factual","factual"],"if_automatic_evidence_enough_to_verify":["yes","no","yes"],"human_evidence":["NA","The Glide ratio of an aircraft is the distance of forward travel divided by the altitude lost in that distance.

Importance: Glide ratio determines the aircraft\u2019s ability to maximize the distance covered during unpowered flight, influencing landing options and emergency procedures. Calculation:","The glide ratio is based only on the relationship of the aerodynamic forces acting on the aircraft. The only effect weight has is to vary the time the aircraft will glide for. The heavier the aircraft is, the higher the airspeed must be to obtain the same glide ratio. If two aircraft have the same L\/D ratio but different weights and start a glide from the same altitude, the heavier aircraft gliding at a higher airspeed will arrive at the same touchdown point in a shorter time. Both aircraft will cover the same distance but the lighter one will take a longer time to do so.","So, 172 as an example... Best glide is 65, and I can tell by the graph that I'll cover about 1.5 NM per 1,000 feet of altitude. Let's get to work! 1.5 NM = 9,000 feet, which means my glide ratio is 9:1, or expressed as slope is 1\/9 (rise over run).

Aircraft Configuration: Factors such as weight, drag, and control surface positions affect the aircraft\u2019s ability to maintain a desired glide angle and achieve an optimal glide ratio.

If all these factors remain constant, the glide ratio will not change. However, wind velocity is a very important practical influence on gliding distance over the surface.

Examples [ edit ] Flight article Scenario L\/D ratio \/ glide ratio Eta (glider) Gliding 70","Aircraft such as airliners may have a better glide ratio than a hang glider, but would rarely be able to thermal because of their much higher forward speed and their much higher sink rate. (Note that the Boeing 767 in the Gimli Glider incident achieved a glide ratio of only 12:1). The loss of height can be measured at several speeds and plotted on a \" polar curve \" to calculate the best speed to fly in various conditions, such as when flying into wind or when in sinking air. Other polar curves can be measured after loading the glider with water ballast. As mass increases, the best glide ratio is achieved at higher speeds (The glide ratio is not increased).","Performance at high angle of attack and a gentle stall are also important. Glide ratio [ edit ] When flown at a constant speed in still air a glider moves forwards a certain distance for a certain distance downwards. The ratio of the distance forwards to downwards is called the glide ratio . The glide ratio (E) is numerically equal to the lift-to-drag ratio under these conditions; but is not necessarily equal during other manoeuvres, especially if speed is not constant. A glider's glide ratio varies with airspeed, but there is a maximum value which is frequently quoted.","The glide ratio is affected by all of the four fundamental forces that act on an aircraft in flight - lift , drag , weight and thrust . If all these factors remain constant, the glide ratio will not change. However, wind velocity is a very important practical influence on gliding distance over the surface. With a tailwind, the glide distance achieved will be increased because of increased groundspeed whereas with a headwind, it will be reduced because of the consequently slower groundspeed. Variations in aircraft weight do not affect the glide angle provided that the correct airspeed is flown."]],"auto_evidence_url":[["https:\/\/www.aviationfile.com\/understanding-glide-angle-and-glide-ratio-exploring-the-key-concepts\/","https:\/\/skybrary.aero\/articles\/glide-performance","https:\/\/aviation.stackexchange.com\/questions\/94635\/how-to-calculate-the-altitude-my-aircraft-normally-loses-in-two-minutes-of-glidi","https:\/\/www.aviationfile.com\/understanding-glide-angle-and-glide-ratio-exploring-the-key-concepts\/","https:\/\/skybrary.aero\/articles\/glide-performance"],["https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gliding_flight#Lift_to_drag_ratio","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gliding_flight#Glide_ratio","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gliding_flight#Lift_to_drag_ratio","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gliding_flight#Glide_ratio","https:\/\/medium.com\/faa\/best-glide-speed-eb89693edaa0"],["https:\/\/skybrary.aero\/articles\/glide-performance","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gliding_flight","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gliding_flight","https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gliding_flight","https:\/\/skybrary.aero\/articles\/glide-performance"]],"stance_claim_autoEvid":[["completely-support","irrelevant","completely-support","irrelevant","irrelevant"],["irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant"],["irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","completely-support"]],"if_claim_needs_edit":["no","no","no"],"claims_factuality_label":[true,true,true],"revised_claims":["Airplane glide ratio is expressed as a ratio.","in airplane glide ratio, Higher numbers in the ratio indicate that the airplane can travel further.","In airplane glide ratio, Higher numbers in the ratio indicate that the airplane loses less altitude."],"usedEvidence_index_in_revision":["-1","-1","-1"],"if_most_important_claim":["yes","intermediate","intermediate"]}}}

Typical combinatorial optimization problems are the travelling salesman problem (\"TSP\"), the minimum spanning tree problem (\"MST\"), and the knapsack problem . In many such problems, such as the ones previously mentioned, exhaustive search is not tractable, and so specialized algorithms that quickly rule out large parts of the search space or approximation algorithms must be resorted to instead. Combinatorial optimization is related to operations research , algorithm theory , and computational complexity theory . It has important applications in several fields, including artificial intelligence , machine learning , auction theory , software engineering , VLSI , applied mathematics and theoretical computer science .","Henry Maltby and Eli Ross contributed Combinatorial optimization is an emerging field at the forefront of combinatorics and theoretical computer science that aims to use combinatorial techniques to solve discrete optimization problems. A discrete optimization problem seeks to determine the best possible solution from a finite set of possibilities. From a computer science perspective, combinatorial optimization seeks to improve an algorithm by using mathematical methods either to reduce the size of the set of possible solutions or to make the search itself faster.

Solution Encoding In combinatorial optimization problems, any solution is an arrangement of elements, combinations, or permutations.

The most common types of representation are (1) a linear sequence of elements (as an array) and a (2) tree that organizes the elements recursively.

Gravimetric energy density Weight is at an absolute premium for applications like drones or aerospace , . In these cases, a bulkier battery can be accommodated by good design, but increased weight always constrains performance, and so the lighter the battery, the better. In extreme cases, such as batteries in satellites, every extra kilogram of weight adds thousands of dollars to the cost of launch. There are also other applications with more prosaic constraints.","However, the battery also powers the life support system on the astronaut's spacesuit as well as the tools and other portable electronics needed to repair the exterior of the International Space Station. Batteries are essential in human spaceflight, NASA is not only concerned about performance, but also the safety. The Importance of battery safety If a battery were to catch fire inside a pressurized capsule, such as the space station, the results could be devastating. Fire inside such an oxygen-rich environment would be literally explosive and \u201cvery definitely catastrophic,\u201d Christopher Iannello, an electrical power expert in the NASA Technical Fellows Office, tells The Verge. \u201cIt\u2019s a potential loss of life situation.\u201d","When energy density figures are quoted without context, it can be hard to tell whether a new battery cell is impressive or ordinary. While they are sometimes conflated, they are significantly distinct and tell us different things about the battery\u2019s performance capability. Volumetric energy density The amount of energy that can fit in a given physical volume is most important for applications that are volume-constrained \u2013 where space matters. Consumer electronics and passenger vehicles are two good examples of this.","Lithium-ion batteries also pack a lot of electrical energy into a relatively small and lightweight battery, and every pound is critical due to use for aerospace. The heavier the spacecraft, the more energy, and money will need to launch it into space. Using smaller batteries on space-constrained vehicles can reduce weight and space, allowing for the addition of other, more important instruments. Lithium-ion batteries also last longer than other batteries for spaceflight. The Russian Soyuz capsule, used to transport astronauts to and from the ISS, uses silver-zinc batteries that last only a few months.","Increasing the volumetric energy density of batteries allows electric vehicles (EVs) to travel further without increasing the size of the battery pack. Conversely, it can allow an EV to travel the same distance with a smaller battery pack, thus saving space, weight, and manufacturing costs. Given the enormous benefit of increasing the energy density of batteries for EVs, there has been heavy investment in battery development by the Department of Energy and private industry that has yielded impressive gains. In 2008, lithium-ion batteries had a volumetric energy density of 55 watt-hours per liter; by 2020, that had increased to 450 watt-hours per liter.

However, the battery also powers the life support system on the astronaut's spacesuit as well as the tools and other portable electronics needed to repair the exterior of the International Space Station. Batteries are essential in human spaceflight, NASA is not only concerned about performance, but also the safety. The Importance of battery safety If a battery were to catch fire inside a pressurized capsule, such as the space station, the results could be devastating. Fire inside such an oxygen-rich environment would be literally explosive and \u201cvery definitely catastrophic,\u201d Christopher Iannello, an electrical power expert in the NASA Technical Fellows Office, tells The Verge.","The heavier the spacecraft, the more energy, and money will need to launch it into space. Using smaller batteries on space-constrained vehicles can reduce weight and space, allowing for the addition of other, more important instruments. Lithium-ion batteries also last longer than other batteries for spaceflight. The Russian Soyuz capsule, used to transport astronauts to and from the ISS, uses silver-zinc batteries that last only a few months. T he lithium-ion batteries currently powering the life support systems on NASA\u2019s space suits are 11 years old and have barely degraded, according to Darcy.","Editorial\uff1aJoe Issue Date\uff1a2019-11-06 Views\uff1a1515 Introduction In the spacecraft, an extreme environment that lacks oxygen and low temperature, which area of battery used should we more consider? The spacesuit. you can't charge your spacecraft with an extra-long power cord - which is why batteries are clutch for space, powering everything from electric tools and spacesuits to satellites and planetary rovers. What they need battery in spacecraft? Many deep-space vessels are equipped with solar panels to power, so most space batteries are used to store energy on spacecraft for use when the sun is out of sight.","This enables the satellite to embark with a larger payload with items such as scientific instruments, specific detectors, telescope, or additional antennas\/emitters and transponders. Since no repairing is possible in space, satellite batteries must provide power during the whole life of the satellite with margin and demonstrated high reliability figures. The batteries are designed and qualified to withstand very high reliability, high specific energy, extreme temperature ranges, high vibration\/shock levels, radiation doses, and long operational requirements. Compared to previous qualified batteries such as Ni-Cd and Ni-H2, the main advantage of Li-ion is its substantial weight savings, which decreases a system\u2019s overall size. Modular Design The Li-ion voltage slope during charge and discharge enables cell parallel assembly, providing modularity.","Lithium-ion cells are more sensitive to overcharging, overheating, and cases of thermal runaway. Thus, battery testing is crucial and any battery used in space must be subjected to rigorous testing before being certified safe for use in space. The difference between batteries used in space and common batteries The lithium-ion batteries currently on the Space Station are extremely heavy-duty and made to last much longer than the average battery used in everyday life. The standards for batteries is space in much higher. Strict and comprehensive testing is needed to meet these requirements."],["In this case the cycle life is defined as the number of cycles the battery can perform before its internal resistance increases by an agreed amount., usually 1.3 times or double its initial value when new. In both cases the cycle life depends on the depth of discharge and assumes that the battery is fully charged and discharged each cycle. If the battery is only partially discharged each cycle then the cycle life will be much greater. See Depth of Discharge below. It is therefore important that the Depth of Discharge should be stated when specifying the cycle life.","Batteries for spacecraft must be sealed to operate in vacuum. They must withstand the acceleration of launch, and vibration while attaining orbit. They must be able to operate over a wide temperature range, and must not emit gases that would corrode the space vehicle, disturb its trajectory, or contaminate instruments or life support systems. Batteries for vehicles orbiting the Earth must also resist the high ionizing radiation level above the shield of the Earth's atmosphere. Artificial satellites, such as communication satellites , require battery systems that can withstand thousands of charge and discharge cycles over the satellite's intended life.","Battery Shelf Life like calendar life is the time an inactive battery can be stored before it becomes unusable, usually considered as having only 80% of its initial capacity. See also Battery Storage Battery Cycle Life is defined as the number of complete charge - discharge cycles a battery can perform before its nominal capacity falls below 80% of its initial rated capacity. Key factors affecting cycle life are time t and the number N of charge-discharge cycles completed. An obvious example is the Depth of Discharge (see below) which is a simple reciprocal mathematical relationship, but there are many more complex factors which can also influence performance. Lifetimes of 500 to 1200 cycles are typical.","See also Cycle Life which shows how cell performance diminishes due to deterioration of the active chemicals as the battery ages. There are important lessons here both for designers and users. By restricting the possible DOD in the application, the designer can dramatically improve the cycle life of the product. Similarly the user can get a much longer life out of the battery by using cells with a capacity slightly more than required or by topping the battery up before it becomes completely discharged. For cells used for \"microcycle\" applications (small current discharge and charging pulses) a cycle life of 300,000 to 500,000 cycles is common.","Even satellites in a geosynchronous orbit experience regular \"eclipse periods\" of varying duration. Vehicles such as the Apollo spacecraft and the Space Shuttle required more power than could be supplied by batteries or solar panels, and so relied on hydrogen fuel cells to provide several kilowatts of power for hundreds of hours. [2] A reserve battery is a primary battery that keeps its chemical reactants separated until needed. This improves the standby life of the battery, since side reactions cannot occur if the electrolyte and electrodes are separated. In another form, the electrolyte is heated to become conductive during operation."],["Reliability is greatly enhanced because the likelihood of serious mission degradation or spacecraft loss is significantly reduced. 1103 : The procedures described in this practice are specifically for Conventional Ni-Cd batteries and are not necessarily applicable to Super Ni-Cd batteries.

The reliability of a certain type component can be expressed as a function of time, , which refers to their average normal working probability before . Under the assumption of Wiener model, the reliability function of lithium-ion batteries in the test can be calculated by Substituting the parameter estimators into ( 7 ), we can obtain the reliability of this type of battery at any given time. In practice, many satellite designers are also concerned about the confidence intervals (CIs) of reliability indices, especially in the fields of risk evaluation and strategy optimization. Compared with a single point value, CIs contain more information on the description of statistical uncertainty.","This innovative technology has the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional lithium-ion batteries, offering a safer, more efficient, and longer-lasting solution for energy storage. In the realm of energy storage, reliability is of paramount importance. It refers to the ability of a system to store and deliver energy consistently and efficiently over its lifespan. Traditional lithium-ion batteries, while popular, have been plagued by issues of safety, longevity, and energy density, which can compromise their reliability. Solid-state batteries, on the other hand, promise to address these issues, thereby enhancing the reliability of energy storage systems.","Some microsatellites, for example, the STRV-1d launched in 2000, the PROBA launched in 2001, and the ST-5 launched in 2006, firstly used lithium-ion batteries to power the load. Compared with the applications on the ground, aerospace products put forward higher requirement in reliability and safety. Generally, failure of batteries will affect the normal operation of satellite loadings and even lead to catastrophic accidents. For example, batteries accidental failure resulted in the halting problem of the Mars Global Surveyor in 2006 [ 3 ] and Boeing 787 in 2013 [ 4 ].

The data migration process also includes data preparation, extraction, and transformation. It is usually conducted when introducing new systems and processes in an organization. A single data migration process can involve different types, including: 1. Storage Migration Storage migration is where a business migrates data from one storage location to another. It means moving data from one physical medium to another.","By embracing these attributes, organizations can navigate the dynamic landscape of data management more effectively and leverage the power of data to drive business outcomes. Bridging the Gap: The Evolution from Data Lakes to Data Lakehouses In the realm of data management, a transformative shift is underfoot. The dawn of a new era is being heralded as organizations transition from traditional data lakes to an integrated architecture known as \u2018data lakehouses\u2019. Data lakes emerged as a solution to manage the massive surge in data volume and variety, from structured to unstructured, that traditional data warehouses could not accommodate.","What is Data Migration? Data migration is the process of moving data from one system to another. While this might seem pretty straightforward, it involves a change in storage and database or application. In the context of the extract\/transform\/load (ETL) process, any data migration will involve at least the transform and load steps. This means that extracted data needs to go through a series of functions in preparation , after which it can be loaded in to a target location.","These capabilities facilitate real-time analytics and machine learning, which was a challenge with the former data lake model. The rise of the lakehouse represents a significant leap forward in data architecture. By offering a holistic data management framework, lakehouses reduce data silos and operational inefficiencies while enabling advanced analytics and real-time insights. As such, the shift from data lakes to lakehouses is set to unlock new opportunities, drive innovation, and enhance decision-making capabilities for forward-thinking organizations.

Principle 6: Build to Scale and Optimize for Performance & Cost Standard ETL processes, business reports and dashboards often have a predictable resource need from a memory and computation perspective. However, new projects, seasonal tasks or modern approaches like model training (churn, forecast, maintenance) will generate peaks of resource need. To enable a business to perform all these workloads, a scalable platform for memory and computation is necessary. New resources need to be added easily on demand, and only the actual consumption should generate costs.","Many organizations have traditional analytics platforms that consist of a variety of tools, which presents integration costs and difficulties.

This is aimed for creating a demand for new product and the new product has to be known to public. To Persuade: Advertisement not only informs but also serves to influence the public to buy the product or services. For example a company seeks to induce the public to buy its particular brand of soap in preference to others.","Advertisement is an efficient way for firms to inform customers about their products and explain how they are better than their competitive products or announce new products in the market. Brand names work as an assurance of the offered products, their brand conveys some information and signals a high level of reliability. Frequently Asked Questions about Advertising What is advertising? Advertisements are the promotion of a product, brand, or service to convince potential customers to buy more of a certain product at a given price level. What role does advertising play in the economy?","The purpose of advertising is to describe the features and characteristics of product or service in the visual form so that the customer can understand it easily. So the advertising has become an important for the business today. A good advertisement persuades the customer to the final purchase and keeps them motivated to do a certain action. So advertising has an important role in the today's business. The advertising not only persuades the customer to buy only but also gives them the options that can be considered when they go to purchase to distinguish the products among many."],["Digital media outlets have happily stepped in to fill this gap. Despite this changing landscape, for many companies advertising remains at the forefront of how they deliver the proper message to customers and prospective customers. The Purpose of Advertising Advertising has three primary objectives: to inform, to persuade, and to remind. Informative Advertising creates awareness of brands, products, services, and ideas. It announces new products and programs and can educate people about the attributes and benefits of new or established products.","Advertisements builds Company\u2019s Image: The general purpose of advertisements is to build a company\u2019s image. Practically all companies try to build their image through advertisements. Some consider it as the primary objective of advertisement. For example, Godrej, Lakme, Vimal, VIP have built up an image through advertisement. It is largely assumed that if the company has some image or reputation in the market, it will be easy to sell its product.","Table of Contents 1 What are the Purposes of Advertisements? For a given market target, there are six purposes which an advertisement seeks to attain. It is possible to achieve more than one type of objective with one single campaign; but that is both difficult and costly. Whenever a company seeks to achieve more than one purpose through advertisements, it must make sure that the various purposes are in conformity with its overall marketing strategy.","Basic purposes of advertisements: Awareness; Reminder to use; Changing belief about the brand; To assist salesmen in marketing products; Generating direct sales; Building the company\u2019s image. Advertisements create awareness: One of the most widely accepted purpose of advertisements is to increase the recognition of a brand name or product, or to communicate information about the availability of the product to the public. This is an important objective from many point of view. First, when a new product enters the market, it does not easily gain the favor of the buyers unless they are well informed about it. That is, an awareness about the product must exist before a favorable attitude toward the brand can be developed.","Overview Advertising is a way of marketing your business in order to increase sales or make your audience aware of your products or services. Until a customer deals with you directly and actually buys your products or services, your advertising may help to form their first impressions of your business. This guide gives advice on where and how to advertise, and what advertising can achieve. It also shows you how to manage the advertising process and ensure you get value for money. Before selecting a type of media, you should find out from the media business and other independent sources about their circulation or audience

A two-dimensional pseudo single phase CFD model has been presented to describe the flow and mass transfer behavior. In the CFD model, both the resistance and bubbling effect of the uprising gas phase to the liquid phase are considered. In this paper traditional 4-pass tray design strategies including equal bubbling area method and equal flow-path length method were used to design the tray. Based on the proposed model, the liquid velocity profile and concentration distribution of both vapor and liquid phase on the tray were calculated. Simulated results show that there exists strong non-uniformity on one part of the tray while it is relatively uniform on the other part. To optimize the tray configuration and hence improve the tray separation efficiency, two modified tray structures were invented by adding several deflectors and changing weir shapes, respectively. Calculated results reveal that the Murphree efficiency of optimized tray is 1.94%~4.73% higher than that of traditionally designed tray.\nLink: https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/267345401_214198_Multi-Pass_Distillation_Tray_Optimization_by_Computational_Fluid_Dynamics_Method"],"auto_evidence":[["Liquid and vapor are mixed on each tray, thus effecting a stage of distillation.

This also helps create a fair pricing structure for customers who use electricity during off-peak hours. Time-of-use pricing can benefit customers who are able to shift their electricity usage to off-peak hours, reducing their overall electricity costs. However, it can be a challenge for customers who cannot easily shift their usage. Peak hour pricing electricity costs are much higher than at other times of the day.","DSAS is important to both the supply and demand sides of the electricity market and is conducive to the interactions between the two parties. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate a pricing strategy for DSAS. This pricing strategy for DSAS should consider the cost of providing the service, the level of demand, the value of the service, competition, and regulatory requirements [ 78 ]. The cost of service provision includes equipment, maintenance, and labor. The price should be set to cover these costs and provide a reasonable profit margin for service providers.","Utility companies can use this pricing strategy to encourage energy conservation among high-usage customers. For example, a utility company might have a block pricing system where the first 500 kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity used monthly is charged at a lower rate: for example, USD 0.10 per kWh. Any usage above that amount is charged at a higher rate: for example, USD 0.20 per kWh. This encourages customers to use less electricity to stay within the lower-priced block. A declining scheme could also be used where the price per kWh decreases as usage increases.","In addition, through numerical analysis, we also find the relationship between energy management results and the reward weight factors in MDP, and the economic boundary of system energy management in some extreme cases. The pricing strategy proposed in this paper mainly focuses on electricity price and thermal price. With the gradual implementation of the carbon trading mechanism in the energy market, the trading and pricing of carbon emission quota will become the key factor in the future energy trading market. Therefore, in the future research, we will consider the carbon trading prices into the multi-energy pricing strategy.

Because of sea level rise, projections at the end of the 21st century indicate even moderate waves might cause damage comparable to that of extreme weather events, according to the study. Griggs, who was not involved in the research, said it adds to growing scientific data showing how fast the world is warming and how quickly seas are rising. \u201cWe know hurricanes are more intense and last longer, and now we\u2019ve got, you know, waves increasing in power. So those are all consistent,\u201d he said.","State Farm\u2019s decision echoes a similar declaration made by Allstate in November, which announced in its third quarter 2022 earnings report it would stop writing new policies for homeowners insurance in California. More frequent and severe weather events have been attributed to climate change, which leads to more risks for damages and higher policy premiums. According to The Ascent , \u201cIn 2021, there were 20 weather events that cost the insurance industry at least $1 billion dollars, above the annual average of 12 severe events since 2000. Fourteen of those events occurred in the U.S.\u201d Nationwide, there\u2019s a growing trend of many insurance companies\u2019 hiking rates, limiting coverage, or declining new policies altogether.","\u201cPremiums are rising in Colorado amid wildfire threats, and an Oregon effort to map wildfire risk was rejected last year because of fears it would cause premiums to skyrocket,\u201d says ABC News . \u201cScientists say climate change has made the West warmer and drier over the last three decades and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive. In recent years, California has experienced the largest and most destructive fires in state history. \u201cSome California homeowners already are going without coverage, and a shortage of new policies could make it more difficult to buy a home.\u201d \u201cIn California, the loss of large insurers could create more pressure to loosen consumer-minded policies that have held down rates in the state for years,\u201d ABC News adds.","Other studies have shown waves are not only getting taller but also more powerful.

The state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legendary fog often hugs the coast from roughly Monterey north, usually during summer months; it often burns off by midday before rolling in again at dusk. Farther inland, summers are hot and dry, winters cool and wet, with occasional brilliant blue days and temperatures cold enough to freeze puddles on the ground, but not much more than that.","The climate of California varies widely from hot desert to alpine tundra , depending on latitude , elevation , and proximity to the Pacific Coast. California 's coastal regions, the Sierra Nevada foothills, and much of the Central Valley have a Mediterranean climate , with warmer, drier weather in summer and cooler, wetter weather in winter. The influence of the ocean generally moderates temperature extremes, creating warmer winters and substantially cooler summers in coastal areas. Temperature range [ edit ] Further inland, the climate becomes more continental , with some areas turning semi-arid (K\u00f6ppen BSk ), with colder winters and markedly hotter summers.","The high mountains, including the Sierra Nevada , the Cascade Range , and the Klamath Mountains , have a mountain climate with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer. Ski resorts at Lake Tahoe , Mammoth Lakes , and Mount Shasta routinely receive over 10 feet (3.0 m) of snow in a season, and some years, substantially more \u2013 leading, for example, to annual ski races on the Fourth of July . On the east side of the mountains is a drier rain shadow . California's desert climate regions lie east of the high Sierra Nevada and southern California's Transverse Ranges and Peninsular Ranges . Despite its long coastline, California is not vulnerable to tropical cyclones .","The ENSO cycle has a huge effect on rainfall and snowfall patterns in California, especially during the winter and spring seasons. During the El Ni\u00f1o phase, the jet stream is located south through California, allowing for warmer temperatures and more heavy rains to occur, particularly in the southern portions of the state. During the La Ni\u00f1a phase, the jet stream is much further north, and therefore the far northern portions of California are wetter, while the southern half stays cool and dry. Incidences of dense fog in Los Angeles have been decreasing over time; researchers surmise the change may be a consequence of both the urban heat Island effect and decreased air pollution.

From the approach of structured programming and a machine-independent build to the simplicity and availability of pointers, C has many features that make it a good choice for a programming language. The following are the best C features: 1.","C has some features, such as line-number preprocessor directives and optional superfluous commas at the end of initializer lists, that support compilation of generated code. However, some of C's shortcomings have prompted the development of other C-based languages specifically designed for use as intermediate languages, such as C-- .

A C program written on one operating system can run and compile on any other OS with little to no machine-specific changes.

In many ways, Linux is similar to other operating systems you may have used before, such as Windows, macOS (formerly OS X), or iOS.","Linux has more things going for it though. It has a large community of developers reviewing its code and making sure there are no back doors. Some have called Linux the most secure OS simply on the grounds of its large \u201cteam\u201d of Linux user-developers around the globe. The diversity of Linux distributions (as opposed to the relative monoculture on Windows) is another shield for Linux users. Some of these distributions have been built specifically around security.","By Peter Loshin, Former Senior Technology Editor Stephen J. Bigelow, Senior Technology Editor What is Linux? Linux is a Unix-like, open source and community-developed operating system (OS) for computers, servers, mainframes, mobile devices and embedded devices . It is supported on almost every major computer platform, including x86, ARM and SPARC , making it one of the most widely supported operating systems. How is the Linux operating system used? Every version of the Linux OS manages hardware resources, launches and handles applications, and provides some form of user interface.","I think that is a lie with any system and how do you know when most Linux users probably don\u2019t use security software. In fact there are few vendors who even develop security software for Linux. Seems to me that I wouldn\u2019t take someones word that uses Linux that its free from attacks. I do think Linux has to potential to be more secure by design, but certainly not impenetrable. Apple made similar claims about Mac OS for years until it became more popular and a attractive target."]],"auto_evidence_url":[["https:\/\/techjury.net\/blog\/linux-statistics\/","https:\/\/techjury.net\/blog\/linux-statistics\/","https:\/\/techjury.net\/blog\/linux-statistics\/","https:\/\/blog.packagecloud.io\/10-most-popular-linux-distributions-and-why-they-exist\/","https:\/\/www.tecmint.com\/top-most-popular-linux-distributions\/"],["https:\/\/opensource.com\/resources\/linux","https:\/\/www.techtarget.com\/searchdatacenter\/definition\/Linux-operating-system","https:\/\/www.techtarget.com\/searchdatacenter\/definition\/Linux-operating-system","https:\/\/www.techtarget.com\/searchdatacenter\/definition\/Linux-operating-system","https:\/\/www.redhat.com\/en\/topics\/linux\/what-is-linux#how-does-linux-work"],["https:\/\/opensource.com\/resources\/linux","https:\/\/www.techtarget.com\/searchdatacenter\/definition\/Linux-operating-system","https:\/\/www.techtarget.com\/searchdatacenter\/definition\/Linux-operating-system","https:\/\/www.techtarget.com\/searchdatacenter\/definition\/Linux-operating-system","https:\/\/www.redhat.com\/en\/topics\/linux\/what-is-linux#how-does-linux-work"],["https:\/\/www.computerworld.com\/article\/3252823\/why-linux-is-better-than-windows-or-macos-for-security.html","https:\/\/opensource.com\/resources\/linux","https:\/\/vivaldi.com\/blog\/linux-more-secure-than-windows\/","https:\/\/www.techtarget.com\/searchdatacenter\/definition\/Linux-operating-system","https:\/\/linuxstans.com\/is-linux-really-the-most-secure-operating-system\/"]],"stance_claim_autoEvid":[["irrelevant","irrelevant","completely-support","irrelevant","irrelevant"],["irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant"],["irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant","irrelevant"],["completely-support","irrelevant","completely-support","irrelevant","irrelevant"]],"if_claim_needs_edit":["no","no","no","no"],"claims_factuality_label":[true,true,true,true],"revised_claims":["Linux has a strong presence in the enterprise and server market.","Linux is known for its stability.","Linux is known for its scalability.","Linux is known for its security."],"usedEvidence_index_in_revision":["-1","-1","-1","-1"],"if_most_important_claim":["yes","intermediate","intermediate","intermediate"]}}}

As the training datasets get smaller, the models have fewer examples to learn from, increasing the risk of overfitting. An overfit model is a model that is too specific to the training data and will not generalize well to new examples.  In the example above, the model on the left doesn\u2019t really capture a meaningful signal in the training data \u2014 it hasn\u2019t learned much at all. The model on the right is too specific to the training data \u2014 it has learned every training point really well. But if we were to generate a new prediction with the model on the right, there is a good chance it will be far off. The model in the middle strikes a balance between a being too general to be useful and too specific, or overfit.\n\nFinding this balance is trickier with smaller datasets, because the model has fewer examples to learn from, and because it is more difficult to check if it is overfit. A reliable way to check for overfitting is to score your model on data the model has never seen before, often referred to as a validation, or holdout, set. An overfit model is likely to have a greater error on unseen data than data it was trained on. With small datasets, setting validation data aside provides your model with even fewer examples to learn from, and you have fewer examples to set aside as holdouts to verify the model isn\u2019t overfit.\n\nTake the example of a clinical trial. We\u2019re looking to predict a response to a new treatment, and have quite a few predictors to work with. We have plenty of predictive features from each participant\u2019s medical record, but the training sample is limited by the number of patients who participated in the clinical trial. It becomes challenging to tease out which predictors are actually associated with the response to the treatment, and which predictors are simply associated with the outcome due to chance. In a large study, we could set aside, or hold out, enough patients to test out our model outcome \u2013 we know what the true outcome was from the results of the trial, and we can check if our model consistently arrives at the same correct conclusion having never seen the holdout patient records during training. However, with a small study, each patient record removed as a holdout both eliminates a valuable datapoint with which to train the model, and only provides limited verification that the model has fit to the actual underlying physiology.\n\nTo handle these challenges, we offer a few suggestions here and many more in the full video. \n\nOne technique to get around these problems is to use simpler models, since they can be less prone to overfitting. With DataRobot, you automatically get a ranking of what models work best based on out-of-sample scores,  but you will often see simpler model types making it to the top of the leaderboard when modeling with small datasets. Models like the elastic net classifier, support vector machines, or Eureqa models often do well. Regularized linear models, for example, tend to work well because they are both relatively simple linear models and  do a good job of feature selection, or feature reduction. Forcing the model to use fewer features reduces the risk the model fits to noise or spurious correlations.\n\nLink: https:\/\/www.datarobot.com\/blog\/using-small-datasets-to-build-models\/","NA"],"auto_evidence":[["Learn more about Teams Best forecasting model for time series analysis on small dataset Ask Question Asked 5 years, 8 months ago Modified 5 years, 8 months ago Viewed 2k times 0 $\\begingroup$ I'm building a model which predicts the GDP(Quarterly) of my country.

Removing the impact of outliers from data is essential for getting a sensible model with a small dataset. 7 Effective Ways to Deal With a Small Dataset include: Choose simple models, select relevant features, Combine several models, combine different models, and use regularization techniques to keep a model more conservative. For example, logistic regression is a simple linear model with limited number of weights. Company Mentioned data-science # data-science # machine-learning @ kate-koidan Kateryna","If we have small data, running a large number of iteration can result in overfitting. Large dataset helps us avoid overfitting and generalizes better as it captures the inherent data distribution more effectively. Here are a few important factors which influence the network optimization process: Optimization Algorithm: Gradient descent is the most popular optimization algorithm used for neural networks. The algorithm performance directly depends on the size of the training data. We may try updating the weights with a smaller training set (stochastic gradient descent being the extreme case when we do updates with single data point) which makes the training process fast however the updates have larger fluctuation.","However, when applied to data outside of the sample, such theorems may likely prove to be merely the overfitting of a model to what were in reality just chance occurrences. In all cases, it is important to test a model against data that is outside of the sample used to develop it. How to Prevent Overfitting Ways to prevent overfitting include cross-validation, in which the data being used for training the model is chopped into folds or partitions and the model is run for each fold. Then, the overall error estimate is averaged. Other methods include ensembling: predictions are combined from at least two separate models, data augmentation, in which the available data set is made to look diverse, and data simplification, in which the model is streamlined to avoid overfitting.","Follow this awesome blog for detailed understanding and implementation. Fig 5: Meta-learning in action[ Souce ] 3. Addressing the lack of Generalization 1. Data Augmentation: Data augmentation can be an effective tool while dealing with a small dataset without overfitting.

When a model has been compromised by overfitting, the model may lose its value as a predictive tool for investing. A data model can also be underfitted, meaning it is too simple, with too few data points to be effective. Overfitting is a more frequent problem than underfitting and typically occurs as a result of trying to avoid overfitting.

Keep in mind that an incorrect diagnosis can affect a patient\u2019s medical coverage. Physicians and coders should pay close attention to accurate documentation, code assignments, and reporting of diagnoses, signs, or symptoms that are included in a patient\u2019s medical record. The ICD is revised annually and the 10th revision will go into effect October 1, 2013. Annual minor updates and three-year major updates are published by the World Health Organization.","The ICD-9-CM codes are for the disorder or disorders you are treating while the CPT codes are for reporting the procedure or procedures you performed. The ICD-9-CM is coordinated and maintained by the federal government while the AMA maintains and updates the CPT codes.

In most cases, three-digit ICD-9 codes identify diagnostic categories, and they should be used only if there is no four-digit code (ICD-9 refers to these as \u201cdiagnostic subcategories\u201d) within the category. Some physicians assign a three-digit code when a specific diagnosis is not clear at the time of the initial encounter. Even under these circumstances, a four-digit or five-digit code must be used. For example, if a physician concludes that a patient has allergic rhinitis (diagnostic category 477) but has not yet determined the specific allergen, he or she should submit the four-digit code for \u201ccause unspecified\u201d (477.9)."],["Print Related Pages ICD-9-CM is the official system of assigning codes to diagnoses and procedures associated with hospital utilization in the United States.

Now two things spring to mind: 1990 and the music in that year. Violator follows some conventions of nineties pop-music but with a dark underbelly. Depeche Mode\u2019s direction with Violator was intriguing because the albums that had been produced before never quite had the same depth or imagination. Their previous songs such as Strangelove would be the foundation for Depeche Mode\u2019s sound on Violator .","On March 19th, 1990, Depeche Mode released their best selling and critically acclaimed album Violator .
